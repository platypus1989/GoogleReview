"SUBWAY®Restaurants","1187 Highland Ave, Needham, MA 02494, USA",4,1,"Giovanni Schettini",1495129728,"4 months ago",1,"Worst subway experience I've ever had. Portions are completely different than any other subway I've been to and I get the exact same salad every time. The whole way through I kept asking the individual if it was correct portions and he kept saying yep. The amount of spinach given was so little that you couldn't even see the spinach amongst all the other ingredients. The individual helping me, heavier set older man, kept putting the salad in the mix bowl and then back into the tray. Handled my food as if it was raw meat he was dealing with. No care whatsoever that I'm watching him handle my food so poorly. I was expecting some kind of remedy for the lack of spinach but that's not what happened. Literally had to leave the subway store. "

Bottled beer was OK, taps could use a cleaning. Napkins and silverware were dirty, spotted and stained. Service was slow. Food was not great and carelessly made (onion ring bits in iur friend pickles?). Too bad, fond memories."

"McDonald's","343 Cochituate Rd, Framingham, MA 01701, USA",3.1,1,"Alicia Ross",1506718650,"in the last week",4,"Fairly clean dining area, friendly and polite workers. Some of the cashiers speak primarily Spanish, but it makes sense because of the diverse population in this area. There's always someone working who speaks better English though. Today there was a grown adult customer who threw a public tantrum because of a cashier's thick accent, but the shift leader handled the situation with smile and in a very professional manner. Today, I also noticed that Law & Order: SVU was on the TVs in the dining area, which doesn't seem like a family-friendly choice of programming. Besides the TV and the misbehaving customer, this was a pleasant experience. The fries were hot and my correct order was ready faster than I anticipated."

"SUBWAY®Restaurants","295 Middlesex Ave, Medford, MA 02155, USA",2.4,1,"Daniel Almeida",1458010844,"a year ago",1,"1) They don't accept some coupons for specific products.. One day I got a ""$3 dollar any purchase"" coupon and they didn't accept for ""Subway Club"" saying they didn't accept that coupon for that sandwich - and I read the small print in the coupon and it would say ""ANY"" purchase! Another day I had a $ 1 off any purchase and they didn't accept that for salad - the coupon also said ""ANY PURCHASE"", so they simply choose what is better for them to accept or not.

2) They treat you like trash when you want them to accept the coupons they should be accepting.. they say things like "" - I don't care"", ""- call the cops"", and everything. 

3) All the workers are fake, they simply don't care about your claims and complains.

Use this place just for bathroom. That would be a good use for this business"

I have tried a few, and I got to say JJ's has figured out all the right secrets to formulating the 5/5 sub.  Aside from a sub bread's general appearance, quality and taste, I care a lot about the bread thickness in relation to its fillings, or how ""bready"" a sub is.  Well, they nailed it - the bread's never been too thick and/or too chewy, and a there's a faint hint of a certain sweetness that makes the bread pop with each of the sandwiches I've tried since they opened.  I don't go out of my to post a review often, but I wanted to confirm to all that there is no longer any reason, under any circumstance, to consider visiting a Subway instead.  Don't get me started on Schoolhouse Pizza, their chicken gave me food poisoning."

Last night after a hard day of work I took a walk to Quincy Center to grab aome food from Jimmy Johns. I at exactly 10:25pm the chairs were up on the tables & it looked like they were preparing to close. I asked a woman that was exiting are they open, she replied they close at 11pm. I went in & the girl at the register gave me an awkward look & I asked ""what time do you close?"" She replied ""Im a little bit"". I asked her at what time do you close...she again did not give a specific time reiterating that they're closing. I told her that she didnt have to lie & per the online info you close at 11pm. All i wanted was some food after a hard days work. She proceeded to tell me that they ""guy"" in the back already cleaned up. With that said I will not be spending my hard earned money at Jimmy Johns & will pass it along to my neighbors/friends."

The sliders for daughter were good. One beer came in a cracked glass. Can happen and was replaced easily after request.  Waitress was nice.
Just nothing special about it."
"John Brewer's Tavern","7 Highland Ave, Malden, MA 02148, USA",4.1,2,"MyCollegeBox Ma",1499271249,"3 months ago",1,"I witnessed a horrifying scene here a few days ago. A family was sitting at the table behind me (the only black people in the restaurant). My wife and I had the same waitress as them; who kept coming up to our table, but did not once go to theirs the whole time they were sitting there. She brought them food but did not give them any silverware, napkins or anything.  They were very calm, I turned over to one of the people on that table and told him to ask for a manager seeing how rude the waitress was to them and how nice they were about it. I heard them ask for a manager and refuse to pay a gratuity, this kid was very polite, the whole time.
 The manager came over, he explained the situation to her, and my wife and I were just shocked to hear the manager completely berate him and tell him how rude he was to the waitress when we heard the entire conversation. She said her waitress was upset which I did not get why, when she was the one being rude to this family the entire night.
 The manager then starts screaming at them in front of everyone and the guy only then yells at her, telling her to be respectful . She screams at them, telling them to leave and even called the police who refused to remove them, and everyone saw it. I think the Police told the manager she was wrong, and everyone sitting there could see it. After the officers left the place, the family eventually got up and took off as well. Good for the police for standing up for people like that. Shame on that manager for her awful behavior in the face of her staff's obvious racist behavior. Such people and behavior should not be tolerated.

If you read this review, good for you for standing up for your family dude, and even better how you kept calm. the waitress and her manager were absolutely wrong for the way they treated you, maybe it wasn't but it really felt like simple racism to my wife and I sitting there and we definitely are not going back there.

It was not my first time at John Brewer's, but it surely is the last."

They informed us the kitchen closes at 1030pm, so the 90 minute all you can eat option would be cut short. 

That was the point of us going here to have a leisurely meal?

The restaurant is incredibly loud. Lots of pushy people waiting to get in.

Maybe I'm spoiled as I've been to these restaurants in Japan. Seriously, management & staff, go see how those places are run. Take notes. 

Oh, and once again, the bartender didn't know what a grapefruit or lemon sour was. 

Food was decent but not worth the price, time, disappoint and aggravation."

Move along folks. The logo even bears a striking resemblance to the Longhorn's chain restaurant. (Side note: the world will never know the glory of my original review due to Yelp's mobile app glitching out deleting my draft review!) My sweet SO wanted to take me out to a nice place to eat while also finally using up our Phantom Gourmet gift card, which is surprisingly difficult partly because the website list of restaurants is not up to date. He found this restaurant and it seemed promising with all these positive reviews, so he also called ahead of time just to confirm that the gift card would be accepted. A misinformed individual erroneously affirmed that we could use it, so we couldn't wait to get there! 

Upon arrival, we asked again about the our reservation and the gift card however the hosts were singing a different tune. They needed to check with management. Much to our dismay they told us that they were featured on Phantom Gourmet, but they do not accept their gift cards with a halfhearted apology. Well what a waste of driving here, but we were hungry so they had us by the stomach. The host lead us to a strange location sandwiched in between the noisy bar and a booth, which was later filled with a larger group.

One point of pride that I cannot deny the restaurant was the top notch holiday decor. As we entered, there were 2 life size nutcracker statues along with various lights strewn all over the walls. In the main area they also have a large tree, Santa with presents, a fire place and more festive tidings everywhere.

Our waiter was a courteous gentleman who gave us a solid appetizer recommendation for the Steak Tartare at $15. However, as soon as the other tables with larger groups filled next to us, his attention quickly diverted to them. Also anyway you slice it, I can't imagine any area of the restaurant being romantic since it all wraps around this huge noisy bar in the center. As for the main course, I ordered their signature burger with sweet potato fries and was sorely disappointed with the sheer lack of flavor at ~$14-15 especially compared to a Black Iron Burger or even Shake Shack. This was also the cheapest entree on the menu... and everything else is closer to the $20+ mark. My SO ordered their full rack of ribs at $24 with regular fries, which were tastier but still not worth the price tag. At least the food was ready quickly as we finished up sooner than expected. I couldn't wait to finish up and continue on with our night of errands."
"Stockyard Restaurant","135 Market St, Brighton, MA 02135, USA",4.3,2,"Adam Krueckeberg",1498056142,"3 months ago",5,"Always fantastic.  One of our favorite places, both for special occasions and for a nice dinner out.  The service is always good, but the food is what really matters.  The soups are very well done, particularly the French Onion.  The main reason we keep going back is for the steak tips, which are made of filet and which actually come​ out the way you order them.  Many places struggle to do steak tips medium rare because the chunks are small... not the Stockyard.  We'll keep coming back!"

I got the sirloin medium rare and it came overcooked. Medium to medium-well. Not a good first impression for a puffed-up steak house. Presentation was decent but their sirloin comes pre-sliced (?? Which is just weird, right ??) but that unfortunately also means our server saw my overcooked medium rare steak and was still willing to served it up like that. Just not a great $100 meal for two. Stick to the burgers, salads and soup."

My food was prepared with an ingredient that I am allergic to, that was not listed on the foodler menu. The restaurant then offered a replacement  meal as compensation. I was not interested in a replacement meal that would arrive at 10 pm. They refused to issue a refund, despite the error being on the part of the restaurant and/or foodler. The restaurant then proceded to text me repeatedly, which was incredibly inappropriate and unprofessional.

I've learned my lesson, and will now only order from Lana Thai in Woburn. Amazing customer service and food there."

We ordered two different pizzas and chicken cacciatore. The pizzas were well covered and very tasty, but slightly undercooked in the middle probably due the amount of topping on them.

My complaint is that, several times now, when I pull into the parking lot, the wait and kitchen staff are standing right there, smoking. Staff standing in front of patrons, who are coming in to be waited on, smoking and leaning against the dumpster and the wall. Are they going to change their aprons?  Are they going to wash their hands? It's a very negative image. It grosses my mother out so much she won't eat here anymore."

It definitely hit the jackpot. The ambiance was absolutely phenomenal; service quick, courteous and personable; and food VERY delicious.

The food is incredibly tasty and very well-prepared, I particularly like the pork hash and the way they cook their eggs perfectly. Another big selling point is the impressive selection of creative and delicious breakfast cocktails, if you're like me and you tend to like fruits and herbal flavors they are certainly worth checking out. I love the decor, particularly their hammer-worked aluminum bar top. It is a charming place to sit and eat, vaguely reminiscent of a French underground station, yet somehow elegant and refined, and you have to admire the fact that they went as far as to install actual gas lights all along the exterior! The value for the money isn't any worse than you would expect in a Boston restaurant of average quality, and its proximity to the Sowa district is another plus. For those who live outside the city and prefer to drive, it doesn't get any better than free on-site parking in the South End!"

Today I wanted something different so got a grilled cheese. The price for grilled cheese is only about $1 less than the small cheeseburger, so I expected a decent meal with options for toppings. I was told I couldn't add tomatoes to my grilled cheese. Ok... Got my food, it was shamefully small and ugly. It was basically a slab of yellow cheese sandwiches between two pieces of small grilled bread. I can make 10x better at home with minimal effort! What a rip-off!!!"

"Mandarin Cuisine","238 Highland Ave Suite 4, Needham, MA 02494, USA",4,2,"Horton Copperpot",1495301304,"4 months ago",2,"1st the good. Very attentive service. They've resisted the fad of underwhelming dinner buffet for almost 30 years. Food is prepared competently and consistently. Unfortunately this consistency goes back to the 80s, if not earlier. The menu is stuck in a time warp with zero creativity. They prepare traditional American Chinese food well but that's all they do. There's no regional approach or modern dishes. There are no splashes of flavor or understated variety. It's boring. The best part might be the chicken wing throw-in. Fresh fried chicken wings infused with 5-spice flavor and covered with crispy bark put to shame the stale flavorless appendages served at other establishments. But, in the end, they're just chicken wings."

The menu is pub fare, but done well. Excellent steak tips, a buffalo chicken pizza that uses blue cheese in place of tomato sauce then has the buffalo sauce dribbled over, and burgers that may not be up to Bartley's standard but are excellent in there own right. They also offer good cocktails. I rarely give five stars but this place deserves it."

It's really not the service, because you can hear when the ""order up"" bell is rung. What is taking so long? I have been here multiple times and it's always the same issue, no matter how busy; it's just much worse when it's crowded.

The three eggs were cooked perfectly as requested but the hash was nothing but grizzle. It was so bad it actually looked and tasted as if they emptied the grizzle catcher from the grill onto my plate. The waitress was very good from the beginning to the end of our meal yet she commented that it looked dryer than usual and never had a complaint about the hash before.Once she saw that it didn't look right  she should have returned it to the kitchen before serving it. Under no circumstances should the meal have been served. It is apparent no manager is overseeing the restaurant as a visit to the table was required."

I got the linguini Bolognese and my fiance got ravioli with a buttery white sauce that was also very tasty. The atmosphere was cozy and had nice mood lighting. It wasn't louder either, so it's perfect as a romantic date place. Parking is easy to get to on the streets nearby. Staff was very nice although almost too much as they thought we weren't satisfied and offered to change our dishes when instead my fiance and I were just having a long discussion! It's a bit pricey but the quality is good. Just note that this is almost entirely Italian, it doesn't include Greek or Lebanese as the term ""Mediterranean"" would suggest. Overall a pleasant experience...I would go back!"

I ordered another drink because I didn't want to pay $10 for juice and the same thing happened so the bartender made it four times until she got it right and the manager came over. He was very nice and obviously very good at his job. The restaurant was clean, service was fast and attentive. I had a bacon allergy and inform the server, the kitchen sent my food out with bacon. I ordered ribs and they were burnt. It will be a while before I return back to this location. Also should mention that the appetizers came out the same time as our entrees.

Right away a server name Sheri asked how many of us were there, we told her five or six if the sixth person comes. She rolled her eyes and told us the kitchen was about to close in 30 minutes. Okay fine whatever. I order just water (I went really for the ride). My friends ordered soda and their food. When we got our drinks she didn't give us straws, we had to call her back and get some. When the food arrived two of my friends got tacos and the shells weren't even cooked. She gave us silverware but only gave us like two minutes to grab a pair before she took them away. 

Before we ordered our food we ordered for the friend that was running late. When he sat down she came out and gave his soda and meal in to go containers. Umm what?!? I know you guys are closing in like thirty minutes but that's not perfessional at all. She then started taking our plates and drinks away with out asking if we wanted a refill or anything because the dishwasher is complaining he was closing dish. Again very unprofessional.  She then got annoyed when we had asked her if we could split the bill she sighed when we asked. 

The only good thing that came out of this night when the very flamboyant man at the bar. He came over and said hi and told us a few jokes that he had with an older woman the nigh before. I wish I got his name. He made our night. "

We went to Royal East restaurant; they serve both Chinese & Malaysian food. One of my colleague is from Malaysia, and recommended the authentic Malaysian dishes. 
For appetizer, we had Roti Canai, Satay Chicken & Poh Piah. The satay chicken was too good, specially the sauce that came with it was very different than the normal peanut sauce that you get in any other restaurant. I loved the roti canai as well; the roti was fresh & flaky (which is good) & the chicken curry that was served with it was just awesome!
For entree, we ordered Kurma Lamb, Hainanese Chicken, Beef Rendang, Pineapple Shrimp, Chicken Rice and Coconut Rice. The kurma lamb was spicy, flavorful but not hot and the beef rendang was hot & spicy. I did not like the Hainanese chicken much, as it is a steamed chicken dish, so I found the smell of chicken in it very strong. The rice dishes were very tasty too.
All in all food was very good, every bite bursting with flavors and absolutely tasty. Being in Cambridge area it was obviously very busy, but the host was very courteous. I will definitely visit Royal East again and recommend you to try this place as well."

They even do falafel wraps, some really good salads, and awesome veggie pizza. So, it can be a healthy place to eat. I suggest steering away from the burgers, though. Oh, and during winter time try one of their soups - they are out of this world!"

"Comella's","1302 Washington St, West Newton, MA 02465, USA",4.2,2,"Victoria Sidoti",1500032538,"2 months ago",1,"Ordered takeout. Unexpectedly priced pizza toppings at about $6 each, which doesn't show up on the menu. We waited to try the food to see if it was worth the price, and it was absolutely awful (except for one specialty pizza). I'm so sad that I tried this place."
"Comella's","1302 Washington St, West Newton, MA 02465, USA",4.2,2,"Vince Cheney",1500078952,"2 months ago",1,"So I'm no stranger to Italian cuisine. I come from a large Sicilian family. So when I proposed we try Comella's to my group of friends I really looked foolish when I came away with nothing but regrets and empty wallets. 

Let me break the entire meal down for you. I ordered stuffed shells. When I ordered stuffed shells I couldn't hear the woman over the phone correctly and it had turned she asked if I had wanted ziti with it. I said sure because I had no idea you put ziti with stuffed shells because that's already a pasta. What I received for 9.50 was two stuffed shells of normal size and about 75% of the container was ziti. That is technically stuffed shells as there were 2. The taste was middling and inoffensive.

My fiance ordered fettuccine Alfredo which seemed to be white sauce plopped unceremoniously atop dry fettucine. She mixed in the sauce herself. The taste is middling and inoffensive. 

My best friend ordered a chicken and onion pizza. That cost him 6 dollars for just the chicken. How much chicken you might ask. Around 50 cents of tasteless crumbles. The layer cheese was so thin it seemed like pinkish skin with red tomato blood through. The entire pizza cost roughly 15 dollars for what any other place might charge a hard nine. The taste was middling and inoffensive. 

My best friend's girlfriend described her sandwich as tasting more like the salad dressing than the ingredients. It cost 5.99 which wasn't horrible. The price was middling and inoffensive. 

My roommate ordered a cheeseless pizza as he has a dairy allergy. Thankfully Comella's remembered this. However the rest of chicken and red pepper pizza was unimpressive. The middle was not cooked and the dough seemed melt to the box. The pervasive issue of a 6 dollar topping of chicken continued on here. The taste was middling and inoffensive.

My roommates wife ordered Taylor Tuesday which is a pizza combo consisting of mozzarella and basil for 13 dollars. The taste was middling and inoffensive.

Overall if you're looking to waste money on inferior food and poor service then Comella's is perfect for you. I'd highly suggest spending your money at any other pizzeria in Newton, especially West Newton Pizza Market. Despite being owned by Egyptians it seems that they understand the Italian way far better than signore Comella."

The food was delicious, my clam chowder was not overly thick and had nice big chunks of clam, some places I have been to chop up the clams so finely that I cant find them.

I had decided to take my fiancé for her birthday as she had never been. The main dining hall was and always has been a beautiful place to dine. The ambiance and the food were both amazing per usual. However the service was beyond atrocious. Our waiter (Kyle) was inattentive, forgot to bring us things that we ordered or asked for as acompaniments for our meal. We had made an open table reservation (under Dean M) and put in our reservation that we were celebrating her birthday and upon arrival again asked if we could have something brought out with a candle, which was never brought out. Also when asked for our food to be to go, it was never brought out to us. Please make it a point to train the staff in proper etiquette when before we were done ordering our waiter brought us our bill. Upon speaking to the manager (her name begins with an M and escapes me at the moment) she was equally as dismissive as our waiter was the entire. What should have been a celebration of great company, amazing food, and wonderful ambiance was ruined by extremely poor service and dismissive management. Very sad to have to leave this review."

"Nicholas' Pizzeria","33 Chapel St, Needham, MA 02492, USA",3.6,2,"Siobhan Greene",1465599854,"a year ago",1,"I ordered pizza from here twice because so far as I could tell it was the ONLY pizza place that delivered to where I was. First time, pizza was overcooked but okay. I was hoping the over--cooked pizza was a bit of a fluke and ordered a second time (both times online).  Email said 45 minutes but 1hour and 15minutes later still no pizza (so sad). We called and they said there was no record of the order. We asked for a refund because despite no record of it, we were charged for the order. Twenty minutes later, the order magically showed up after we ordered  pizza elsewhere and someone had gone to pick it up. We turned away the delivery and are hoping they still refund us the money. It was disorganized and confusing. Despite the convenience of delivery, I will NEVER order from here again."

"Desfina Restaurant","202 Third St, Cambridge, MA 02141, USA",4.2,2,"Dimitrios D",1501115021,"2 months ago",4,"This is the best traditional Greek restaurant in the greater Boston area hands down.

They have the most complete, and most authentic, Greek menu around.

For starters, they have octopus, which in itself sets this place apart from other local Greek places, which often only seem to carry calamari. 

The food is also usually quite good. While it's not the best Greek food I've had in my life (and no, I'm not comparing it to food back in Greece, but rather to other Greek places in the U.S.), it's been consistently good.

The staff is also friendly and nice.

I without reservation recommend this place if you want a real Greek restaurant experience in and around Boston."

Service:  Gather is located at a shared office space.  We were seated quickly and the service was great. 

Food:  A surpringsly great clam chowder was followed by a HUGE helping of chicken and waffles.  The chicken was homestyle and they deep fried the waffles. My wife got the corned beef hash.  All the food was bountiful in their helpings and served piping hot.

Price:  The price was pretty high.  Chicken and Waffles was $23...you definitely get what you pay for. "

The large cheese pizza is only $6.41 after tax, you can't beat that, especially for its quality. This place is my go-to for pizza parties since you can get a lot of good pizza for not a lot of money. Their tomato and marinara sauces are especially noteworthy since I'm usually somebody who doesn't like tomato-based sauces, but I love them here.

The only thing I haven't liked on the menu was their fettuccine alfredo. It wasn't even alfredo, it was just a bunch of gooey cheese on top of pasta with little flavor. I'd say anything with alfredo is the only thing I wouldn't recommend here, but everything else is great."

The spicy tomato mussell appetizers was one of the best dishes I had in Boston.  A meal unto itself.

The restaurant itself is smaller, and it can be a bit loud when it's busy (which is was on Saturday and also on a Thursday night).

We had wanted to go to another restaurant in the area, but couldn’t get a booking, so we decided to check out the Zef- Cicchetti and Raw Bar.
We arrived early enough to get a seat and we were extremely pleased with our choice. I loved the atmosphere of this restaurant, as the bar area was open and tables were uncluttered and well spaced. Also, it is connected to Alba’s restaurant, so you can move between both easily. They have a great selection of both beer and wine, which was reasonably priced. 
We started with the polpette, which are meatballs in a tomato sauce and they were very tasty.
For the entrée, my husband had the pork osso bucco and he raved about it. The meat was slowing cooked, tender, and flavorful. It was served on mashed potatoes and had a masala sauce over it. It was a big serving and he was extremely happy.

I had the black truffle gnocchi, which was served with short rib, wild mushrooms and a sauce. It was delicious and although the plate looked small, it was extremely filling and delectable.

I think what made the greatest difference of this restaurant was the bar staff and our server Leo who was personable and attentive to everyone that he served. I will be back to visit soon and would recommend it to everyone."

It has that taste of ""authentic flavor"" to it. The wood stove adds to the ambience. Note that this isn't a cozy, quiet place for a romantic dinner.

Once I received a poorly cooked piece of fish; the waitress took it away, the manager came over immediately to apologize and ask what I wanted as a replacement.  The replacement meal came quickly, was really good and the cost was removed from our bill.  That courtesy is rare in any level dining experience these days.  When my grandson traveled with us on one business trip he was treated like a prince and asked to go back.  He then requested dinner at the 99 in Albany, NY when we were headed for the airport nearby to pick up more relatives.  The only drawback at that time was there inability to seat an infant in a car carrier in some way other than squeezing the infant w/carrier and the parents into one side of a booth... work that out with the fire-marshall or unclutter the tables to include space for an infant seat/high chair.  The meals were good and the service friendly here also... just tight quarters."

That is ridiculous! Usually they would try and make it right by giving a gift card for having to go back one time 3 times I was in tears. This time I got nothing and when I got home and opened the steaks it was literally the smallest steaks I have ever seen. One literally had 3-4 bites.. Worst service ever and never recommend to my guest at the hotel I work which 99 is across the street now I'm gonna tell my guests not to go to 99!! U can't get ur food they way u want.

However, the entire group of paying customers I was with was turned away and told that we weren't allowed in with sleeveless shirts. I immediately noticed that in my direct sight, there were at least 15 people wearing shirts without sleeves.  When I mentioned this to the host who was turning us away he said he could get his manager.  We told him that it wouldn't be necessary and that we would take ourselves and our money to a better place where we would be welcomed and not turned away for an irrelevant reason.  So for other people looking for good seafood in Boston, I would suggest trying any place other than Tia's."

They don't take reservations yet they wouldn't let us put tables together or move around. Also the chef wouldn't allow for substitutions, which really doesn't make sense to sense the sides are that pivotal (usually french fries, at least the sides you would want to switch out). 

I'd recommend going here on a Tuesday or Wednesday, hopefully the lack a crowd in the bar will humble them and make them give better service

We waited for 10 minutes seated at the bar before the bartender even took our order. We waited another 15 and the drink never arrived.

The chairs were so closely packed that they touched and there was no place for a glass of water and the dipping dish.  The fried rice had a scant amount of veggies and 3 eggs for 10+ people.

"Summer Shack","50 Dalton St, Boston, MA 02115, USA",4.1,2,"Varun Mitra",1503793021,"a month ago",5,"This is one of the best sea food places in downtown Boston. Ambience there actually resembles that of a shack along a beach side. Food is hearty, fresh and good. I have been there 3 times and I have had the lobster roll on all occasions. Lobster is done to perfection. Bun crispy and buttery and lobster drenched in butter. 
Drinks are good and served in really fun looking glasses. My favorite is the pineapple chi chi.
Definitely worth the visit."

It was almost as cold inside and I had to keep my coat on during my meal. Don't expect fruit toppings like the pictures in this listing because they don't offer them. They don't carry real maple syrup either or any flavored syrups other than your everyday corn syrup. From where I was sitting, I had a view into the kitchen through an open door and it didn't exactly encourage my appetite. The one waitress in the place was a bit rude and inattentive, only brought me 2 eggs when I ordered 3, and as we were leaving, covered a sneeze with her hand, then went directly to handling customer orders without washing her hands. I will not go back and wouldn't recommend the place to anyone."

Upstairs turns into a 20's aged club Thur-Sat after 10pm. The owners actually work bar or tend to front of house which is nice.  Has a 23 oz $4 domestic beer which is the best in this neighborhood.  Food is good; I'd recommend the Brisket Reuben with the Macaroni and Cheese.  They have pulled pork, ribs, and brisket as well, I wouldn't compare it to NOLA or Texan spots but it is probably the best in Beantown.  It is also 1 of 3 bars open until 2AM near the Garden."

The corn bread that came with it tasted like cake....?? I was soo very confused by that. Not to mention the mixed drinks/cocktails were so sweet and sour. Barely any alcohol in them whatsoever. Maybe their beers are another story. I even ordered a simple Tito's with soda water and it only tasted like soda water. Complete waste of money."

The staff was amazing and the drinks were awesome. Some of the best drinks I have had. The menu is very limited, which is fine.. The disappointment was with our main course. I had pork 3 ways and my wife had the swordfish. The pork 3 ways was tenderloin over cooked 2 ways and one raw. The salad was the best part of the meal. Hate to drop a 2 star but if I pay that amount for food it better be amazing. QC the plates before they leave the kitchen."
"Craigie On Main","853 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA",4.5,3,"Nick Cipponeri",1499447762,"3 months ago",5,"The burger itself was enough to give this place 4 stars. Tender, with waves of flavor as you bite and then chew, the burger nearly melts in your mouth. So Craigie on Main got the one big thing right. But they also do all the little things right too which is why it earns 5 stars. The bartender was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The steak fries were crisped perfectly while still keeping the potato inside soft and flavorful. The bun, just the right size for the patty, topped with sesame seeds, grilled on the inside without being crunchy, threatened to fall apart as I finished the burger but never did. The cheese was subtle but gradually came into its own and enhanced the flavor of the meat. Portions were sensible. Service was quick although in fairness they knew i was coming and what i was ordering. I left a little poorer but greatly satisfied!"

 Had a reservation. 
Lots of empty tables and booths. 
We were seated at a tiny 2 person table against the wall next to the front door.
 Asked for one of the empty booths.
 Hostess grudgingly moved us to a booth next to the server's prep area.
Food was quite good though portions were small.
Our server was polite but not too warm or friendly.
No, I would not go back or recommend Waypoint to anyone."

This one puts an absinthe spin on a familiar west side of the Charles play on mid-priced food.  Raw oysters, fine, lobster fries (why we went with this recommendation I don't know) just fries in the end, whole bronzino acceptable, but under seasoned and nothing memorable.  That's it...there's nothing memorable about this restaurant...nothing to separate it from the pack."

Otherwise, next time say 45 minutes and I'll show up an hour later.

A trap for people because of it's location near the university. Atmosphere was fine, but staff, the waiters were careless. Good with refilling water but a bunch of them, nearly all would gather and chit chat during busiest hours. And make fun and gossip in their own language about other customers right in front of them. Thought that was very rude - I saw it being done to one family. Was always watching and commenting about them like entertainment. Probably won't come back ever again."

The owner takes pride in his sandwiches and takes every order and oversees everything that gets sent out.  You can tell he takes pride in what he is doing.  The bread is all fresh and the sandwiches are giant.  A small which typically runs around $6 is a full foot long and it is loaded with fresh goodies.  A large which is around $10 is 2 feet long!  You could easily buy a large and split it between 2 people and have a meal for $5 and all the fixins are FRESH.  The place packs up at lunch time with a line out the door, but they are quick about making the orders and getting you eating.  There are healthy choices as well.

The waffle fries with cheese were outstanding. The ice cream was ok. I thought it was pricey. When I went in at 7:30, the staff was all high school students. It took 15 minutes to get my meal.
I wanted a shake (frappe in New England), but couldn't justify spending $7 on it. Cleanliness rated 4 out of 5. Some seats had tape to repair hoes on the vinyl benches. The floor was clean except an area with pepper split on the floor."

What can I say… I  feel at home when come here. Greeted by the Valet like an old friend, always a smile at the hostess station and they are so thoughtful to save my favorite table… Moment later my server Eddie arrives and we start talking life and food… In that order. Eddie knows the menu an is always on point with just the right recommendations. When I come here they know, Eddies my guy. Moments later Hoshang the General Manager comes to Welcome me.

Eddie’s first recommendation… The Salmon Tartare… Tossed with diced Mango, jalapeño, Shallots, Olive Oil, Lemon Juice over a Cilantro Crema . And add in a slight drizzle of Herbed Oil , Shaved Radish, Pickled Chanterelle Mushrooms alongside a house made Brioche… This is a light appetizer that comes alive on your palate.. The jalapeño adds in a slight kick which the Cilantro Crema offsets. Magical!. 

Edie’s second recommendation… The Piedmont Beef… A 10 Oz Flat Iron Steak, Sweet Potato Crema, Charred Cipollini Onions topped with a wonderful Au Poivre… You’d think I used a squeegee to clean the plate! Steak, a perfect pink center medium… Onions, charred to perfection. I don’t really eat onions, my wife will concur. Au Poivre is something that every chef prepares a little different. They way Chef Alex does it puts the “O” in OMG!

I wasn’t going to order dessert but good luck. with that with Eddie… Chocolate Crema… Semi-Sweet Chocolate Mousse, Chantilli Cream paired with an Espresso Biscotti. I’m not exaggerating when I say it’s as good as the ones my Italian mother-in-law and I make at home. Wow!

And as usual I cap it off with my signature Cappuccino…I’ll be hitting the Elliptical tonight.

Thanks for another fabulous dining adventure guys… I’m already looking forward to the next time…

L'Andana Grill - Burlington, Ma - 3/29/2016

From the minute the valet grabs your key you just know it’s going to be a great night… The layout is beautiful, the people are super friendly and the service is over the top...My server Eddie knows the menu inside out sideways and backwards and made some awesome recommendations for tonight’s feast.

The first thing he brought out was the ciabatta bread… Toasted with Parmesan, olive oil and dusted with salt, pepper & oregano… Ornately placed in the olive oil was a ball of slow roasted tomato paste… It was really quite spectacular...

The next recommendation was the cauliflower with roasted parmesan and pomodoro… A perfect accompaniment to any dinner not often offered in other restaurants… 

And then there was the Tortellini… Maine crab meat farcito, sweet pea purée & parmesan crema… So beautifully garnished I felt guilty for eating it…

The Gnocchi was over the top… House made ricotta, henn of the woods, parmesan crema, marsala and truffle Oil... This dish would be tonight’s MVP! Wow…, there are no words...

My main course for the evening would come from the sea… Wood grilled striped bass, cauliflower purée, English peas, baby spring onions, baby carrots, parsley oil… Tender and flavorful white flaky fish with a seasoned crust…With a side of fire roasted shishito peppers… The smokey flavour of the wood came thru nicely...

The final touch would be the perfectly crafted cappuccino… The head was perfect and the flavour bold…

Having been here before, my expectations were high… However high they were, once again they exited them. They do an incredible job here and I will definitely be back and recommend that you go there as well."

Food quality was good but unfortunately the service that took over 50 minutes to even get a drink (let alone the fact that we mentioned up front that we were in for a quick meal).

Maybe it's because it's Sunday or maybe understaffed tonight. Either way the service was horrible with no refills, good came out and server ran off to get silverware which took her 5 minutes, and several tables had not been cleaned around us for stretches of up to 20 minutes."

We ordered the snap pea salad and squid to start, which were both delicious. Then the gnocchi and the half chicken, also both amazing. The chicken is served with drippings from the rotisserie making it so moist and full of flavors. Haven't tried anything bad here yet. The decor and ambiance are very nice and modern and the service was very good. Amazing selection of wine and beer as well for all price ranges. My only complaint is that it's hard to get a reservation, so book in advance. "

Some appetizer standouts that my wife and I tried were the garlic grilled squid and the sugar snap pea salad.  For a main I had the grilled Maine salmon, which was excellent, and almost tasted like rotisserie chicken but with the consistency of salmon, of course.  My wife had their butcher's steak, which I had a bite of, and it too was excellent.  

The service was polite and efficient.  "

It is run by the same folks who own and manage Eastern Standard in Kenmore Sq so you know you're in good hands. The space is huge with ceiling that seem to be in the clouds. At the back is a huge open fire rotisserie turning out delicious whole chickens and whole heads of cauliflower. Their beer lost is ever changing and in my opinion one of the best in the Boston area.  Upscale food in a charming New England setting within a historic building "

Lamb skewers were good too. However I believe the food is overpriced and other options on the menu are a hit or miss. Menu is rather limited. Service was good.

My wife and I came in from out of town and stopped into Finch before a Celtics game.  We walked in and prior to opening, the place was bustling as they were getting ready for a party.  A gentleman in a nice suit came over to us a little surprised to see us as we came in the back door accidentally. He greeted us with a smile and was prompt to have us come in and take a seat and got us a couple of drinks.  He left to check if his kitchen staff was in yet...thankfully they were.  He offered anything on the menu, we ordered and the food was great!   We stopped by their bar on the way out for a drink and the bartender told us that the gentlemen was one of the big shots of the restaurant.  The great experience we had is obviously part of the culture from the top.  They could have easily told us ""sorry we don't open until later"" and we would have accepted that.

I then requested a lemonade instead of the soda and she gave me an attitude, took a deep breath and walked away (leaving the flat soda on my table and didnt bring me the lemonade) after 10 min of sitting there I went to tell another waitress what happened and that I decided to cancel my order and the ""Manager"" interupts and tells me he has already taken it off... So I asked him if he was the Manager cause he didnt introduce himself as such or listen to what I was trying to say before interrupting. He stated he was an apologized with a stern voice where then when I explained why I was upset at the service and asked that he charge me for the 2 drinks and he said ""you're all set"" and walked away (meaning I didnt have to pay for the flat soda and juice my daughter ordered). Very unprofessional and poor service.

We ordered three different kinds with distinct flavors from briny to creamy, all delicious. I ordered the seafood risotto. Although it looked small, it was packed with a variety of seafood in every bite and filled me up fast. It was very good. The staff was very attentive to us and the customers around us. Although it was busy, everyone worked together to bring us what we asked for. I was very happy with my experience."

My family and I were welcomed in by the kind owner while looking for a place to eat. He got us a table right away. The  building is nice but the service, not so much. The servers didn't know the menu well and gave contradicting information. The water was served often but warm without ice. The pasta dishes we ordered were very small, the chicken Marsala and Parma were good sizes though. After waiting an hour and a half I receive a plate with just 6 normal size butternut squash ravioli! We were all still hungry after eating here when each dish was 23$. Also our meatballs had to be sent back for still being frozen in the middle. However, the food was delicious. Not worth the price at all though. Also the bathrooms were out of order when we went. I will not be returning sadly. "

We had the whole lobster with pasta and lobster linguini. Lobster was fresh and tasty. The linguini was very good as well. The pasta that came with the whole lobster was slightly overdone. Also ordered their stuff fig appetiser. The figs were very small and there were 3 of them. They were tasty but in my opinion not worth the $16 we paid for it."

Extremely poor service, filthy bathroom and sub-par Italian. Asked if the risotto had cheese in it due to an allergy to most dairy products. They said no cheese in the risotto. It had so much cheese that you could see strings when you pulled a small bit away with your fork. I was told it had cream added to it. Risotto gets its creamy texture by cooking it properly. "

The couple 6"" behind you head will be hollering the entire meal. The table behind your date will be bellowing the entire meal. We couldn't hear the waiter. The waiter couldn't hear us and brought the wrong wine. It was beyond unpleasant, it was painful and left my head aching and my ears ringing. I couldn't wait to get out of there. I have actually been to a heavy metal concert that was quieter than this restaurant. If they just put some carpet under the tables, or hung any sort of decoration on the bare walls, or used curtains, or hung a tapestry over that ugly mural painted over wads of used bubble gum the place would probably be much quieter. The food was good but I didn't enjoy it, I just wanted to leave. If they do take out give that a try, but otherwise spare yourself a stressful experience. "

You can't get good service therefore not many people seem to be in there anymore during the week.  Last time I went was with my aunt and a few family members the first week of January, and our service was less than acceptable.  The time before that visit we waited for someone to seat us for five minutes (with NO ONE in the place).  Then when seated for 20 minutes no one came over so we finally got up and left.  

As I said it's a great place with lots of potential so not sure what has been going on the last 1-2 years, but that's my experience during that time. Again it's a great location, but management and service needs a lot of work. People (including myself) would starting coming again if there were some positive changes.  Most of the problems I notice is during lunch time."

It also often attracts families with kids and can get very loud. Maybe it's due to the very high ceiling?  "

The riccota looked like toothpaste squeezed  on the pizza. Vegetables are different every time I order. No lemon or spices this time. They forgot my salad that comes with  the  chicken parm. Everything tasted fine but the food should be more consistent considering it wasn't busy."

Total of 7 people amongst 3 tables.  Waited 20 minutes for  drinks.  Server FINALLY came out to bar area with 2 coffees for a party of 3 who were doing dessert.  DESSERT  and she still hadn't acknowleded us.  I had to flag her down as she walked by us once again!  Salad arrived with a brown, rotting, cherry tomato.  It was so disgusting and bloated.  When I brought it to her attention, she felt the need to educate me as to what it was,""That's a cherry tomato cut in half."" No, it is a piece of rotting garbage, and by the way, I know what a cherry tomato looks like and had a number of fresh ones on the plate.  Whomever plated the salad appears to find patrons ignorant and thus deserving of spoiled food. He/she couldn't miss it.  Or was it a practical joke at my  expense? Didn't think I would notice, presumably.  No apology for her inattentiveness,  nor the choice to include an inedible on the plate.  INSULTING!  Brought it to the attention of the Manager and his response was that he had been informed. Gee thanks for that.  A very rude awakening!"

The tables are crowded together resulting in a claustrophobic and noisy experience. This could be excused if the steak was as exceptional as I had remembered it from my last time there. Unfortunately, it was tough. Finally, it was hot and humid inside. To there credit, they did turn the temperature down when I asked."

The bar keeps its own list, and give them your name and # of people when you show up, and they'll seat you.  It's great not to hover waiting for a spot.  Bartenders are fun, and make great cocktails.  Food is simply some of the best you can get."

I don't know much about Korean cuisine, but I got the Impression this place isn't staitght traditional Korean. Looks like there are the standard Korean dishes, but also other things like a Janese noodle menu section.  A lot to choose from.

Found on street parking easily at 5:30 on a Friday. The place was clean, had a comfortable modern feel. Korean pop music and video were paying which I liked. Started with the Oppa's steamed buns with spicy pork. Prob my favorite item of the meal. So good. Tried the scallion pancake. Great flavor. Def a heavy, filling app so be be hungry if you order it and/or plan on sharing it. Tried the kimchi fried rice which I loved. Good flavor, texture, and spice. Also had the Yakisoba with spicy pork which was great. I would def recommend it. 

Service was great, the waitress was right on top of keeping waters full, clearing stuff quickly. Food came out timed just right for each course. I found the menu to be very reasonably priced for sit down dining and the portions were more than enough for me.

All around great experience. I'll be back and bring some friends!"

"Godavari Restaurant","9 Cummings Park Dr, Woburn, MA 01801, USA",3.8,NA,"Sohang Chatterjee",1504578291,"a month ago",4,"One of the most authentic tasting South Indian food in the region. Their Ala carte is not the generalized Delhi menu and taste that is often passed off as Indian cuisine. Though the Buffet is mundane. After renovation, the place is cleaned up. Bunch of friends running the place. Expect it to be more fun than stiff propriety. But service leaves scope for improvement."

Also you will be missing starters and find it later once you finish off the main course. May we should call it as finishers. Overall taste and ambience is good.

We had to put our name down ourselves.... Once we got seated, we waited for menus to be handed out and after a long wait we had to ask for the menu...   order vegetarian curry... mediocre taste and no one bothered to fill our glasses with water and to top it all they come and tell us its our last chance to order more food even though there was about 45 minutes left to closing time...
Never going back and will not recommend it to anyone"

I had the ""North Carolina pulled pork sandwich"" which was supposed to be ""tangy"" - it was just low-quality pulled pork swimming in grease. I had a side of fries, which consisted of an extremely small portion of food service fries that were raw in the middle. If I wasn't miles away with my carry out order, I'd have given it back and asked for a refund. The prices are fairly high for BBQ, so there's definitely no value for money to be had here. Given the wide variety of other dining choices in the area, I'd give this one a pass."

The seafood is always fantastic but today I had the steak tips with mashed and broccoli. Excellent! I sat at the bar as I was alone, first time I've ever done that since the place opened about 20 years ago. The bartender was professional, polite and personable. It didn't hurt that she was very easy on eyes. I shared a story about noticing the new sign they put up about a year ago and noticing that I didn't like it but I never noticed that the new sign also had a new name, she agreed with me and confessed she still uses the old name. It went from ""The Inn At Bay Pointe"" to ""The Bay Pointe Waterfront Restaurant"", not a big deal, same ownership.

The calamari was lightly seasoned and plenty for two. One disappointment was that the pina colada was weak. Overall a pleasant experience with nice casual atmosphere, attentive staff and good food."

The service was fast and attentive, but I felt like they were just trying to flip the table quickly.  If you are looking for great Italian, don't waste your time on this place."

Ugh! I get sick EVERY time. And that's not an overstatement. There are other restaurants I've been to where I've gotten sick a few times, but with this particular store, I get sick every single time no matter what I order. The meat is hard and old, the little they give to you. The other small servings of sides that they fill your burrito with are nasty and often uncooked or lacking in many ways. I'm done going here. Mexican food is not hard to mess up, but they mess it up every time. Top that off with terrible service and .... yuck!"

I been there with one of my friends and she is so fond of seafood and we have been told about try seafood stuff in Boston.
We ordered coast to coast tuna and crispy fish tacos along with few cocktails. We have been served by the waiter (Name starting from D, sorry forgot) and he was so helpful right from the starting. 
Food was good especially tuna...
Plus point is, it is near to Quincy market where they say almost 20 million people visit each year, so you are at the prime location. Old state House-Boston common-city hall-kings chapel-Faneuil hall-Boston harbour is at walking distance.
I would definitely recommend this place."

The second came out without the mashed potatoes but still oil on the vegitables. The third time it came out the salmon was raw.The management didn't seem to care.

Ordered the almond crusted trout and I've never ever had such a badly treated fish in my 20+ years of fish food experience across the world. The fish was overcooked so bad that I had to use fork and knife and struggle with it. It was drenched in so much of oil and I couldn't eat more than couple of bites. The green beans were rotten on the ends and the cook didn't even bother to trim them off. Wish I had spent my hard earned money elsewhere. Don't even get me started on the service - No water refills, was waving my hand at different waiters for service (one saw me and just turned his head as if he didn't see me) and had to wait like 30mins to get the check. There are some serious management issues at this place and I wish the negative reviews are for the betterment of this place. The irony that a McCormick & Schmick in Boston being bad is pathetic."

My kids and I went for dinner and drinks on a beautiful, quiet Thursday evening. We were immediately seated in a nice location... and everything went badly from that point on. It took no less than a half an hour to get my first drink. Then it was no less than one full hour after ordering that the food arrived. At no time during the wait were we offered a second drink or even water refills. When my ahi tuna finally arrived, it was so bad that I actually sent it back. I have never in my 47 years of life sent back food. Additionally, the fact that we were actually given two distinctly different menus  confused the staff and resulted in a frustrating ordering experience. P Nice location, nice atmosphere, but abysmal service and unacceptably bad food."

Had reservations for 4 at 7pm. We were seated immediately and our waitress, Grace, took our drink order for non-alcoholic beverages. She walked us through the menu and helped us pick out a drink for the table. We decided on the shipwreck, not too sweet, not too much alcohol; and it was on fire! Heftier bill than you will find in Chinatown, but far surpasses in quality and atmosphere."

Red lantern far surpasses all of them. In terms of quality of the food the quality of the preparation and the quality of the ingredients. THEY ARE ALL TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN AT RED LANTERN! My favorite is the hot rock with the salmon in the beef in that sauce they give you was beyond words. My second favorite is the house fried rice with the Wiyagu beef in the great shrimp!"

First enter the restaurant smell like dirty kitchen,   dinning room:  floor is fine, but the tables are dirty, an opened trash barrel left at the corner of the restaurant.  
Customer service:  worst worst ever!!!  no greeting, no smiles.  At the registry, chatting with the other employees and manager (I'm stand right there wait for him to take my order)  cashier (Nathaniel )attitude wasn't rude nor polite, no smile, no greeting.(again)
I placed the order, don't know how much was the total until I look at the registry screen and he didn't even tell me how much change I'm getting back.  Overall, foods are fine, but I would never ever go back to this Wendy's again.  Otherwise,  I also notified this is the only Wendy's I have see that isn't renovated like the other."

The woman that assisted us (older woman with short hair) was very rude and not helpful at all. I decided to give this place a second chance so I decided to eat there. The first thing I noticed is that their sit down menu is apparently different from their take out menu (they increase their prices). Our waitress was the same woman that I encountered the first time. Again, she was very rude. I ordered steak tips with fries. The steak tips were actually very good but they gave me a very small portion of steak tips and a large portion of fries. When it came time to leave our waitress was extremely nice to us, coincidentally. I will definitely not be going back to this restaurant."

Having a sub done in under 30 seconds or whatever as they say isn't worth it . Subs are bland and I find this worse then subway . Only had 1 kind of cheese ..... strange ..... no Swiss . No American !? Like what the hell is this ? Plus your paying huge prices when you get chips and a drink for an 8inch sub it's almost 12 dollars ! Sooooooooooo I SUGGEST if you wanna stick around you adapt a little bit . Just a little . Your in Boston . Not in the sticks somewhere in some no name town .  Get some variety . Quality cold cuts and then charge me 12 dollars for a sub . I'll be happy to pay it . But you gave me 2 slices of ham and one slice of the only cheese you have and a Ton of dry lettuce . Barely any mustard and put tomatoes on it when I said no tomatoes and no peppers when I said peppers . Chips kinda suck too . Soda was good . Fast service was good . But in the end I felt like I could have had a new born baby make a better sandwich if I put the ingredients in front of them .

Expensive but worth it."

Rooms were like new, updated and very clean. Bathroom had beautiful new standing showers installed. Room service was on time and they responded to all requests quickly! Lobby market had complimentary bottled water for guests which was nice. Would definitely recommend! "
"Boston Marriott Burlington","1 Burlington Mall Road, Burlington, MA 01803, USA",4.3,NA,"Miguel Garza",1500392672,"2 months ago",5,"No complaints at all during a 2 night, 3 day stay. It's about a 30 min drive north of the main Boston area, so you may want to book a place closer if you're there to explore Boston proper.

Other than that, the room checked off clean, big and comfortable. We happen to be there during a time of construction on the outdoor pool/patio so I can only imagine this will be much nicer in the future...."
"Dick's Last Resort - Boston","Quincy Market, Faneuil Hall Marketplace, S Market St, Boston, MA 02109, USA",3.4,2,"Hayley Fitzgerald",1507073234,"in the last week",1,"*Dick's Last Resort at Faneuil Hall in Boston MA.
*Won't go into detail but horrible first and now last experience.
*Waitress was nicer than staff at most regular restaurants. Why??? Should probably be fired
*Chicken tenders (4) $11... very small pieces 
*Buffalo chicken tenders... not spicy at all 
*Southwestern salad... bland 
*Nachos... nasty liquid cheese, boring flavor overall 
*Definately not worth the $60 spent!
*In conclusion, if you're looking for the restaurant with staff who treat you like garbage, don't go to Dick's Last Resort. All you'll get out of them is a dull experience, a long wait, and a hole in your wallet from food with no flavor and subpar quantities. 
*Very disappointed.

Our friends had an amazing experience so took us again. But the waiter serving us (a full bodied guy) was grumpy, not rude in a funny way and wasn't fun like all other waiters or previous experience. Gave us Hats (the most humorous part) in the last minute right before he got our checks and asked for a specific amount on tips, checked the tips we made in front and raised eye brows and said ""really"" on our 15% tips we left. Based on service we shouldn't have given anything but didn't expect him complaining when we actually left tips."

He was serious when we were asking him serious questions and happy to joke with us when we were joking with him. He made us feel comfortable and welcome and his advice was uniformly good. "

Love the food, and the staff is excellent. Primarily, there are usually a large clientele present that seem to be of Asian decent, however, if you know the rule of Asian restaurants, you'll know this to be a good thing! One dish in particular was marked as 'very spicy', and based on my experience with that dish, I will say, their menu markers are quite accurate! If they say spicy, they mean it! Would certainly go there again when I'm in the area, and would recommend them to anyone looking for a good, authentic Asian meal."

Food is okay, but what makes the experience is customer service, right? You're met by a crotchety seasoned lady with all the attitude one would expect from a local dinner dive. Tuna tar tar tasted like it just came out of the freezer for the first time in a decade. If you pay top dollar for oysters, please hire someone that knows how to shuck, not fun spitting out shell pieces!"

The Pros:
- Valet was very nice and they were quick.
- The app, we got the meatball. Not only did it look good but the taste was like it's appearance.

The Cons:
-  We were sat at the smallest table in the world, right ext to the kitchen. I told the front desk when placing reservations that it was a special evening with my wife and I wanted a both if available.
- My wife got the NY sirloin, asked for it to be cooked Medium. I was surprised with how much effort it took to saw through the steak. In my experience, that's normally a pretty easy cut.
- Somehow, my wife wound up holding the door open for a man that I assume was the GM. She is not above holding the door open for anyone, but as we walk out of your establishment after paying more than $100 for dinner I would think that a restaurant that went as far as sitting out or silverware between courses, would give a ""guest first attitude"". Especially when it's a woman dressed up in heels holding the door for a man that works there.

In all, we won't be back unfortunately. Like I said, I wanted this place to be awesome because the location is great. But if you want a great cut of steak and exceptional service, there are many other places."

Give yours to something local. The desserts are terrible too. Sometimes it okay to leave traditional recipes alone instead of trying to over jazz things. It was late and we were limited on options that were open. Perhaps this is why everything was so bad for us. I hope you have better luck. We are done with this chain."

A spectacular space, I was mesmerized for the entire meal just examining what was around me. That being said, the food and service are good but not great for the price. Food is prepared classicly with great quality but no flair. You get your steak served bare, completely ungarnished with its juices leaking sporaticly over its white plate as it arrives. Weghing the pros and cons, it's  a great place if you're  looking for a classic, high quality  American seafood restaurant."

"WOW Barbecue","184 Salem St, Malden, MA 02148, USA",3.8,1,"Tammy Yeung",1492998504,"5 months ago",2,"The skewers are more appropriate as an appetizer as opposed to ordering a bunch for a meal. They use the same seasoning for each of the meats, which is on the salty side. We ordered the spicy pot which included slices of pork belly, fish balls, shrimp and vegetables. The small order is definitely good enough for 2 people to eat, but is something that can easily be made at home.  We also ordered the chow mein, but that dish was very oily, had very little in vegetables and no meat/protein "

The meals are okay, but you'll be in sticker shock when you go outside and find a ticket on your car!  This restaurant has no parking - worse, they don't tell their customers that the ""parking"" outside their restaurant is actually a bus stop.   You can get there on the bus or Uber, but why would you do that when there are plenty of Chinese places next to the train station?    And would you really wanna take a date on the bus?   Not worth the price when you add in the $75 dollar ticket."
"WOW Barbecue","184 Salem St, Malden, MA 02148, USA",3.8,1,"Jennie Yep",1490478713,"6 months ago",2,"We took out a variety of meat skewers, a couple of veggie ones, tofu/scallion salad, cold Beijing noodle and rice noodle soup.  

The rice noodle soup was the best dish because of the noodle.  We liked the texture and stringy-ness of it.  Different from everywhere else we have tried.  The tofu/scallion salad was not bad.

The skewers were cold by the time we got home.  Foiled wrapped in a box did not preserve enough heat, hopefully warmer when you eat in at the restaurant.  Some of the skewers had some paste/sauce on them that was a bit stronger in flavor than we are used to.

They dad not have available three items that we wanted to order on their menu, this is usually a flag..

Overall, unfortunately, we were just not wowed."

It's a casual place with a bar and Red Sox on TV. I ate new and delicious foods. I kept eating until I was full and then some. Almost until dignity went out the window. It was so good. There is a second more Americanized menu and the items listed there looked plenty delicious (Pad Thai, etc.) but I can't comment on them specifically.

The service was friendly and attentive. There are small alcoves with booth seats and space for fairly large parties. While I was there a group of 10 or so came in and were seated without fuss. The restaurant itself is a quick walk from a couple of different T lines. I walked from Chinatown in less than five minutes. "

"Montien Thai Restaurant","63 Stuart St, Boston, MA 02116, USA",4.1,2,"Shuvaditta Saha",1500343846,"2 months ago",1,"Pros: Food was decent but not great. 3.5 star out of 5 in my opinion.  We took chicken Satay and Winter shrimp roll as appetizer. I will give 4 out of 5. We took tom yum soup. That was just okay. 3 out of 5. As main dish we ordered a couple of curries. Green curry and Massaman. I would rate 3.5 out of 5. Their cocktail drinks were great. 

Cons:  Over pricey and they gave us the bill with 18% tips on top of the bill. Their service was not great. So, I would hardly give them 12-15% tips, if I had an option. But they do not give it an option. I found their staff a bit rude, so i decided to let it go and not argue on sake of not spoiling my day.

They do not accept credit card. They take only cash but they charge sales tax and tax on alcohol cocktail drink (they charge tax twice). You know what that means. The tax they charge on you will not go to govt. It goes to their pocket. We took a couple of drinks. They charged tax twice. Overall, they do a big cheating in billing. Be cautious about it. 

Overall 4 rating was a bit misleading for this restaurant."

.....on my visit I ordered a steak bowl. It was filled 80% with rice, 10% beans, 5% vegetables, 3% steak, 2% hot sauce.
In conclusion, eating at this Chipotle is a practice in holding your composure. I found it to be filthy. The steak bowl was really just steak flavored rice  with a negligible amount of steak. I'm curious who is running this joint."

The whole staff was completely unfriendly. The service was extremely slow. I get a very simple burrito. The girl on salsa was unable to roll it correctly, so it completely fell apart when I ate it. The foil was also covered in a film of sour cream, which I can't stand the smell of. This was due to them not wiping the counter enough. The surrounding tables and the drink station were filthy.

It's a decent place place to eat to if you're a customer who does not pretend to have a fine dining experience. Every item on the menu is an ""Americanized""  version of the real Italian food. It is also a pity that there isn't anywhere to eat outside, especially on the sunny summer day during which I visited Cambridge. The waiter was messy and spilled some of my water on the table cloth by trying to pour it in my glass very quickly.

The cafe is relatively small with seating for about a dozen people or fewer.
You walk in and the order at the counter on the right with the kitchen behind it.
The menu selection is somewhat limited but it helps keep the prices down as it is relatively reasonable.
The serving size is very good and can be large when eating in. Take out sizes look deceiving but the dishes are the same as eating in.
The spicy dishes can be customized to be less spicy and it still taste good.
The pork sandwich is heavy on the dough but good and filling.
The hot and sour soups are delicious. The cafe adds just a tad more in vinegar but that's good for your health ;)
It's located near Woburn Center but you'd never think or know that this cafe existed in Woburn.
Will return to try the other dishes :)"

The atmosphere, the quality, the presentation. It all speaks from the heart. Other eateries should take a note or two from this establishment. 

After beets and corn dumplings, we had the swordfish and chicken.. Both meats were of cooking perfection.. Literally the perfect cooked meat. The chicken was undoubtedly one of the best I've actually ever had. Cooked perfect, juicy in ways i can't describe, the swordfish was the same, succulent and flavorful.. 

The drinks are fantastic, the service is impeccable, the root quality is through the roof, all local, etc. 

People must understand that this is fine dining and not anything else.. Concise menu ensures quality and freshness. I'd  rather have a shorter menu that coincidences with the seasons. Than a typical menu that might not have all produce in season to make it perfect.. If i had children, i would give this place the respect it deserves and leave them home.... 

Amazing!!

Multiple room, booths. Bar separate. But aside from steak tips & pizza, the rest of the menu is competent to mediocre, occasional specials (often seafood). Din is a bit high when full but conversation possible. Good for largish groups [6-8]"

Chill atmosphere, obligatory loud music and televisions playing music videos. Food in the restaurant area is decent enough. The main bar has a good enough selection, though prices are steep. The dance areas in the back and downstairs are small, but I like dancing close to people, so I guess that's a plus? Conveniently located between the Back Bay and the South End, making it easy to stumble into or out of."

Our server, Matt, was more than accommodating. However, due to the poorly trained security staff, we will not return. After being harassed by another attendee who was under the influence of illegal substance(s), and after interacting with others who carried the unbearable scent of such substances, my boyfriend was singled out in front of countless others waiting in line. He was told he was being ""cut off""  from  re-entering despite the stamp on his wrist and the beautiful and calm night we had together at this club, while visiting Boston for the weekend.  No evidence was  presented  to us as we waited for management in front of others, and we chose to leave the premises to avoid any further embarrassment by the staff. "

We stopped in this weekend. Called at 5pm for reservations at 6:30pm. Very glad we did, it was very busy and there were three other groups in the small waiting area ahead of us and a few stopping in for pick-up orders.

The place is large but it didn't feel large or crowded once we sat down. The service was quick and attentive. 

Beyond the seafood, the Bang Bang Cauliflower appetizer was a standout and large enough to share."

I lived in Virginia, where there are several places like this in just about every city of the Hampton Roads area and I think for what it is, a small ""mom & pop"" spot, it's fine. The customer service could be a bit better and maybe the temperature of the foods served should be hotter for safety reasons as well as taste/presentation purposes. I am a restaurant manager myself and have been in customer service for over 20 years so I am big on that.

But many of the menu dishes, most meant for sharing, have been a touch disappointing--especially given the price. Every dish seems to be about 25% overpriced, and not as well imagined as the food at, say, Sarma. The nights I've been there servers have seemed a little overwhelmed, as well. The cavernous space is invariably packed, making the noise level akin to a jet engine; conversation becomes difficult. Similarly, the lighting is kept so low that diners use their phones to read the menu. This is a simple issue easily resolved by candles, which would provide not only lighting by which to read but also a better ambiance than the interrogation light of the iPhone 6."
"LITTLE DONKEY","505 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA",4.5,2,"Jamise Osserman",1500326588,"2 months ago",3,"I enjoyed a few bites of my husband's seafood tower.  I also enjoyed a Turkish dumpling appetizer dish very much.  It was around happy hour when we were there and they were very busy.  We had to wait for a table.  The other things we ordered were unremarkable. Not bad,  just fair.  Their spin on the Pound Cake was an unfortunately disappointing desert. In fairness,  I should say that I was looking forward to, and prefer  traditional Spanish styleTapas. There was nothing there that really begged me to come back another time.  They did a lot of cross-cultural things that didn't quite make a good impression on me. "

Our favorites were the potatoes (they had an Indian spice on them), mussels and french fries (they were super crispy). Got a little adventurous and tried the beef tongue, it was smoked, and it was very good, just strange to be eating tongue. Cocktails and desserts were great as well and the wait staff was very friendly"

Rice didn't even come with the main course which was already priced slightly above normal.

Also, when I went in to pick my order up, the front desk was empty and servers walked by me 4 times - one even stood in front of my face cashing a table out - without speaking to me, prior to the host coming to take care of me.

While I'm not happy about that above, again the food was good, and I imagine I'll be coming back here."

Got the pu pu platter for 2 and everything was great. No issues with that. Didn't eat everything since we are taking food home. 

Scallion pancake was crunchy and delicious. 

Kung pu chicken was good. A bit on the salty side but overall, still a good choice. 

Salty and spicy calarmi was crunchy and delicious. 

Pork fried rice was delicious.

Jellyfish was also decilious. A bit different then what you would see in Chinatown but still good. They mix the soy sauce with it instead of dipping the jelly fish into the soy sauce."

Was in this place on 6/11/16 and half of the table was empty, food was mediocre at best.  Hering was probably just taken out of the glass containers from a supermarket and garnished with onions+dill.   The rest of the food looked prepared but was just ok.  I could make better myself.

Arrived as a group of six before closing hours and were accepted as customers, although nobody had a smile for us from the beginning.

Three people worked on us in order to get us to pay a higher tip, which made us feel as though we hadn't paid for the food we ate and left us with a bitter aftertaste for the whole experience."

I went in with my friends and from the very beginning you could tell there might be a bad experience. The waitress was nice but that probably where the compliments end. She brought 4 unwanted drinks and ignored the requests. It took us 30 mins to just order and when we did end up getting our food a lot was wrong and it was full of flaws. I ordered a medium 10 oz serloin and it came out looking like a over sized hockey puck. It was well done and not that tasty. The mac n cheese was good but the mashed potatoes were sub par. My friend also revived a messed up steak that could have been passed off as a burger. It also had some sauté stuff on it that was not good nor wanted. To top off our experience the fire alarm went off and the whole restaurant needed to be evacuated. It was a very bad experience and I would save the 30 dollars each we had to pay and go somewhere else."

One of us isn't a seafood lover so waiter told her that she can get chicken instead- perfect ... well not so quick. She ordered shrimp scampi just with chicken instead. When the meal came out - no chicken! Really??  Overall not a good night at this restaurant would not hurry back.  "

Thankfully the server was outstanding/attentive & pleasant & friendly!  In general, everyone was happy with their meals...the crab & shrimp dip app was amazing & great value! Unfortunately for 3 of our meals including the lobster casserole, the meals were spicy & all you could taste (we think) was an overbearing flavor of cumin & chorizo flavor....very odd for 3 seafood meals. I didn't taste the flavor of my lobster or sherry at all...what a bummer since the large portion & quality seemed fantastic! Nice location & scenic.

Everything they make is the best of its class. Scones? The best. Muffins? The best. Cold Brew? You guessed it: the best.

Overall, we had a pleasant experience. The service is by far, the best experience I've had in Boston. Each member of the staff we encountered was friendly, knowledgeable and willing to go above and beyond for the ultimate customer experience. 

The food was presented very well, beer selection was solid and refreshingly cold. I highly recommend the house special eggplant fries, fish & chips and nachos with house chili. The sirloin steak special and steak tips however were a definite let down. Perhaps ordering to our taste of medium well was a mistake, however they turned out to what seemed as extra well done which resulted in a dry and charred experience. 

Will most likely visiting again due to the amazing service from the staff.

Or, at least it feels that they have traded some of the homier, Euro style dishes for some American adopted dishes, like quesadillas? The quality and portions don't seem to have dwindled, but I remember always being able to get meatloaf, fish & chips and the like; those items seemed obscured this time around.

Part of the Columbus Hospitality Group. I’ve been to several of their restaurants. Each one is a little different. What remains consistent is unparalleled customer service. I could sit here for hours and just watch them do what they do.

For my first course this evening, the Polpo … grilled octopus, squid ink cous cous, cherry peppers, finocchio… The plating was something to behold… It was like a work of art! The Octopus was perfect. I’m also a huge fan of squid ink. This was the first time on cous cous, normally I have It on linguini Pasta.

And to my surprise, the Chef sent out the Mafaldine… market exotic mushrooms, truffle butter, Pecorino Toscano. This is probably the most interesting Pasta I’ve ever had. Long ornamental Pasta… It really holds the sauce beautifully. And like everything thing the do, house made…

My main course, the Halibut… East Coast, romanesco cauliflower, lobster mushrooms, uni Crema… Yet another masterpiece… It looks so good, you almost feel guilty eating it… I said almost! The thinly sliced cauliflower was the perfect touch with just the right amount of crunch.

Ordinary I would pass on dessert however knowing the caliber of what comes out of the kitchen, I selected the CIOCCOLATO… Warm molten chocolate cake, vanilla bean gelato and my signature Cappuccino…

What an amazing evening! The service, the cuisine, my server Kevin and everyone here made it truly memorable.

I'm not sure if the time we went they were on boarding new staff/waitresses but the entire experience was something to be desired.

Right upon our arrival the Hostess does not see our reservation thinking that we had it for a party of 5 for 4PM instead of party of 4 at 5PM. We were then lead to our table at the farthest reaches of the restaurant by a very young and inexperienced waitress. During the entire time she neglected to check in on us at the appropriate times and did not fill our waters until we asked her at least twice. 

We ordered one appetizer, oysters rocker feller which was very tasty. We received our plain entrees about half an hour later. The grilled haddock special only had one fillet so we sent that back as this was not what we were expecting and ordered something else. The waitress was bewildered by this request at first but she took the order back. In the end they did bring out a complimentary tiramisu dessert to makeup for the previous disappointments. Good on them for at least trying to end on a high note."

Featuring fair prices for the neighborhood, an excellent selection of Italian classics, and a full bar to make this a one stop shop. I've been frequenting bacco now for three years, the friendly waitstaff is one of the many reasons I come back again and again. It doesn't have the overwhelming feeling that some restaurants in the North End can have and is perfect for dinner or drinks with friends, or even alone. "

Others in our party had chicken and vegetarian dishes, which were well received.  Our waitress was very attentive, and the space we were seated in allowed for pleasant conversation.  Parking was a bit difficult, but there is valet parking.  Papa Razzi is a bit on the pricey side, but the meal was good quality and well prepared, so price wasn't much of an issue.

Literally whatever is on the menu they make to perfection, or if you want a special drink, they will create a masterpiece.  The food is amazing as well...I literally ordered seconds just to bring home. The vibe and music is great, and you do not have to worry about screaming over douche bags, in order to be heard, to have a decent conversation and a great time, with who ever your with.

I only ate only a small portion before I put a napkin over it (RIP). burger and fries came out and looked presentable and I did enjoy the meal, beers were tall and cold. customers had smiles and looked pleased. overall a good time. left a good tip and let the bartender know the onion soup was horrendous, he apologized and we were out."

Tibetan plateau is a desert, the vegetables do not grow there, so how come there are so many on the menu? Tibetans are also Buddhists and refrain from eating meat.

We came by after a tour and reached the restaurant at 2:50 pm. We specifically asked them if they're open and they said ""yes"". No sooner had five minutes gone by, they declared the restaurant is closing at 3 pm. We were still okay with that but they started wrapping up the buffet table. I mean, if you were going to close 10 min after we arrived why not tell us that in the first place? We had already started our meal, so they knew we couldn't do anything and took advantage of the situation. Even if they had postponed clearing up everything by 10-15 min, that would have been fine. It's like they let us in just to make a few extra bucks for the day, not cool."

Why? Story time!
We were visiting Needham for a work trip, and Spiga was recommend as ""the spot for a great dinner."" However, our night ended with awkward looks as we tried to settle the bill.

The first card we used was declined. We learned LATER after calling the bank that trying to pay at Spiga flipped their flag for ""possible fraudulent activity."" (Note this is a card that we used to pay for things throughout the trip many time before this meal with no issues). 

The second card we used cleared fine. However, the waiter approached us hostility to ask why we didn't tip. We informed him that since we had a party of 8 that gratuity was included, per their policy. We showed the line on the bill where it clearly showed tip/gratuity.

That wasn't enough for the waiter. He came back to us with the manager. Both of them asked us why we didn't tip. We explained, a second time, that their policy was that parties of our size had gratuity included. That their system CHARGED us tip/gratuity. It was clearly outlined on the bill.

After arguing with us for about 10 minutes, they told us to have a good night. However, I wonder if this is a simple misunderstanding of their own Point of Sale system, or a scam that they use when people are visiting the city from out of town.

PROPS: Food seemed fine. I'll give you 2-stars, hoping this was all an unfortunate misunderstanding. 
SLOPS: See the story above."

"Bertucci's","799 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA",3.7,2,"Tom Therkildsen",1492542469,"5 months ago",2,"OK - First off, it was Easter Sunday and the day before the Marathon.  So some consideration was appropriate.  Because we were a large party (10) we made reservations a couple of weeks in advance.  We are familiar with the Bertucci restaurants and have always had good meals.  However, this experience was a real downer.  It took over 10 minutes to have a server show up to take drink orders - there weren't more than two tables at the time.  Another 5 minutes to get orders taken and then drinks finally arrived.  At least 30 minutes later, still no food, hadn't seen the waitress and water glasses were empty.  Finally started getting our own water.  Also noticed several groups come in, sit down, order drinks and after 20 minutes, they got up and left.  

Finally, at the 50 minute mark, a supervisor (?) came over to apologize - one server had left, three had called in that they couldn't come in, so that might explain the slow service, however the cooks appeared to be overwhelmed (there were two of them, with the supervisor apparently helping them with pizzas.  When the food finally arrived it came in fits and starts, 3 entrees, then a couple of more, and finally 5 minutes after the entrees started coming, the final three showed up.

All in all, as others have noted, while the food is good, reasonably priced and abundant, management really needs to sit down with the staff, find out why they can't seem to get their act together, and make some positive changes, this facility will not make it."
"Bertucci's","799 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA",3.7,2,"Olia Hapych",1492401183,"5 months ago",5,"Amazing place with super nice and caring staff. We had a voucher for one free entree if you buy the first entree by yourself. We didn't understand the concept well at first and confused the manager with a lot of questions. At the end we were told that the manager felt bad because he couldn't explain the system clearly to us, that's why we got one free salmon entree+ one large pizza for free! I was amazed at how honest and caring that manager was.

We weren't even complaining or anything, we were super excited about that free salmon entree anyways,but at the end we got a large pizza for free as well. I couldn't believe it.

Food at Bertucci's is always good, we enjoyed every bite. Their bread and pizza crust is very delicious. Hard to find such a European- style place in America.

I was surprised that people leave bad reviews because of the ""slow service"". I don't agree with that. While you are waiting for your pizza or other food, the employees will always bring you freshly baked bread with oil and spices. 

100% recommend this place!

This place is legit. Pay no mind to ”rudeness”. It's evident this place is culturally sound the moment you walk in. The menu, the vibe, the service, the authenticity 👌 There will probably be a line to get in, but it's well worth the wait. I hear it's ridiculous in the winter, but it wasn't so bad when I went in September. Also note:

• CASH ONLY
• A lot of their dishes have [extremely fresh] seafood
• The staff may randomly yell at one another. Just enjoy it."

You're packed into the tiny restaurant, like many of the places in Boston do. It's a great experience because you get to know the people next to you and everyone is so friendly.  The only downside is that the wait is forever long. Do not come here with more than 2-4 people or you'll be waiting a good hour. CASH only and NO reservations. 
The wall is the same menu with 4 sauce types. The mussels were great but not as impressed with the clams. The Garlic Bread was amazing! The oil and herbs seep into the crevices of the bread. Their staff is great and are used to the hustle and bustle. Some will try to turn your table quickly, while others know you've been waiting for a long time. Definitely recommend if you have time or catch the short line."

It's cash only and they don't take reservations. There are only about 6 tables, and you might be seated at a table with strangers. Once you enter this building, you're part of the family until you leave. My boyfriend tried to order a Coors and the waiter said ""Okay. Have you ever had Italian beer?"" ""No."" ""Let's do that instead then."" It's loud, bustling, cramped, and perfect. The food is obviously delicious and authentic (and reasonably priced!) but it's the spirit of this place that will have me going back. "

The food took a long time to arrive.  When it did, two dishes came first and about five minutes later the other two, one of which was mine.   All I had  to do is look at my Chicken Piccata to be disappointed.  When I gave it the taste test, the pasta was rubbery and cold, some of the chicken was cold and the other piece was acceptable.  I sent it back and didn't order anything else.  The waitress came back and said that manager took the cost of the plate off the bill!  Wow!! Does that mean they expected me to pay for it!!!
What a good manager should have done is personally come and apologize for the inferior service in the kitchen, but no, he must have been really busy on this Tuesday evening when most of the tables were empty.  What a joke! That place does not deserve to be visited.  It pained me to not leave the place since my family was eating their food but it will be the last time I go to this place for the lack of responsiveness from the manager."

We should have walked away when the ""hostess"" ignored us. We walked right up to her as she leaned on the counter. No other customers in sight she was doing something on her phone. She looked at us and proceeded to gather menus. I thought ""ok at least we'll get seated."" Nope. She placed them on the counter and walked away. Minutes later we were seated with a smile like nothing happened. The waiter was in no hurry to refill our coffee. The food was bland. I ordered a scramble and it tasted like something from a college dorm; overcooked eggs, no flavor. The potatoes were the ""best"" part and even they tasted like they were each hand-dunked in salt.

I was thinking about doing an office happy hour on their patio but I'd be extremely embarrassed if my co-workers ate food like this on my suggestion.

"Chart House","60 Long Wharf, Boston, MA 02110, USA",3.9,2,"Nicholas Fay",1501678602,"2 months ago",1,"Overall, Chart House is only OK and a bit pricey. The oysters were mediocre, the rice accompanying the main was lukewarm, but the grilled cod was quite tasty.

Service and the experience is where Chart House fell down during my visit. It took 10 minutes and two attempts to flag my server to get a second glass of wine when there were three tables occupied on the section. It also took a good bit of time to even place my dinner order or have a server greet me upon arrival.

The worst past was the drunk lady who sat at my table and tried to engage me. While sometimes stuff happens, usually already very intoxicated people aren't served at the bar as she was. Additionally, waitstaff don't usually just stand there and watch someone who's had a few too many go to multiple tables and sit down or physically attach themselves to others.

The staff should have handled the situation differently, including by asking her to leave when she tried to smoke inside before being served at the bar.

I likely would not return for another meal."

My waitress struck up a conversation with guests at another table and spent a lot of time talking to them off and on . Took a long time to order , then wait for food then I waited 10 min for the dessert menu then waited another 15 min til she came back for my order . It wasn't crowded . Three tables  that were seated after me with a different waitress finished their lunches before I did. There was another woman seated by herself that also waited till she was served by the same waitress and complained after her meal that she had to wait so long to get her check… She ended up going to the hostess and had to ask for her check .  My son and daughter-in-law had their anniversary dinner there last month and also complained about how bad the service was… I love the atmosphere and the location and the food is generally good but it's not worth the price when you have such poor service"

The waiters were very friendly and surprisingly spoke perfect English, which was definitely a big plus because you could tell them what food you wanted, and they could understand you and bring you your food. The food was excellent. By far the best Mexican food I have ever had in my entire life. It was euphoric, for every bite I took felt like stepping onto a beautiful beach with a beautiful girl, looking at the   sunset of orange and a small periwinkle hue. I will never forget this experience; the birds singing their songs of passion in the background, the waves slowly building up and then crashing softly onto the beach. It was like a dream to me, a dream that is so vivid yet so imganiary because it fades from your memory shortly after you see it. I wish everyday to experience the food of Acapulco once again, and to feel this feeling forever. May anyone who visits this restaurant be eternally blessed with vitality and hopefully see just how profound the experience really is. This.... is the true meaning of life my friends."

The sub rolls are easily the best I've had in years. They actually fill the sandwich with meat instead of sending you off with a half pound of lettuce and mayonnaise. THE PIZZA!!!!  I have fallen deeply in love with their Pizza. It's pretty perfect actually. Beautiful thin crust that folds up nicely and holds all the toppings you could throw at it. If you happen to be in the hood and fancy a slice, prepare your body because each one is a full quarter of a pie. They are a little on the spendy side, but you get your money's worth without question. "

The service was very friendly and the smoked turkey club was excellent.  Of course, I tried and their original Boston Creme Pie and was not disappointed. (The carrot cake, however, left a lot to be desired!) It was fun to soak up the decor as this place is located in a historic hotel (now an Omni) where Malcolm X was a busboy in the 1940s, and JFK proposed to Jackie.  Definitely worth the trip!"
"Parker's Restaurant","60 School St, Boston, MA 02108, USA",4,3,"Thomas DiJulio",1505621323,"2 weeks ago",3,"Pros - excellent service and truly great decor. Food was also very authentic, to the point that eating it gave you a little piece of history. Extensive wine and cocktail list  Portions are large which is great for getting full.
   Cons - overall, food was not as enjoyable as you'd expect for the price. Large portions ended up making their more overwhelming dishes even more overwhelming.

Appetizers were the best part of the meal and by no means a disappointment. My crab cake was almost entirely crab, with a big, fresh crab flavor. The bottom was perfectly browned which tasted delicious and gave it a nice crunch. My girlfriend's cheese plate was also great, the highlights were the brie, gouda and cherry jam. The brie was super creamy and rich. The gouda had a perfectly subtle smokiness and had an addicting, warm, buttery aftertaste. The cherry jam had an intense, tart cherry flavor which, like everything else on the plate, went amazingly with the cheeses. 

Entrees weren't great. The crushed cracker and white wine crust on my baked schrod was almost impercievable and very buttery. With the mound of buttery rice on the side and only a small portion of bland vegetables on the side to cut it, the butteriness became overwhelming, especially because of the huge portion. My girlfriend's venison was elegantly simple but with fairly bland sides. Because there was nothing for the strong gaminess  of the meat to stand up to and because it was such a large portion, it quickly became overwhelming as well.

 Deserts were not great either. My strawberry cheesecake was cloyingly sweet. The white chocolate topping made the sweetness more difficult to handle. A strawberry topping would have cut the sweetness and improved the dish, especially considering that the ""strawberry"" cheesecake only had a quarter of a strawberry in the dish. My girlfriend's Boston cream pie was a bit mushy and the cream filling was lacking a rich cream flavor. Instead, the filling was more like a dense vanilla pudding. 

When you're paying over $70 for a full meal, all of the food has got to be great but it wasn't. Despite going against intuition, the huge portions made my meal worse in my opinion. Other than that, a good experience and I still had fun. Worth a visit if you have the money but not a return visit."

The steak was so fat and gristle infused that I had to keep taking pieces out of my mouth which was rather embarrassing- the dark gravy or sauce was so salty that it completely ruined the vegetables- this was one of the worst meals I have ever been served ( I am almost 70 years old) - On the other hand to be completely honest my honey ordered scallops and she said it was "" DELICIOUS ""

Arrived with 10 people.  Took 20 min for someone to come up to us and offer drinks.  Then due to business expenses, there was an attitude to split the checks up, which now a days its just expected a lot of the time.

Pros:
- The group I was with all enjoyed the food
- Salty topped dinner rolls were amazing
- Great wine and cocktail selection
- Fresh seafood was very good with perfect garnishes
- bathrooms were clean 
- offered bag/coat check
- front staff was very friendly

Cons:
- The cost of some dishes were ridiculous for what you actually received
- Many portions were tiny, we had to order quite a bit to fill up
- their prices reflect the area they are in, not necessarily what you get from it
- The serving staff was, at best, indifferent.  They weren't friendly when you walked around, mostly ignoring their customers
- Getting drinks took over 20 minutes and continues to be as slow after

Servers were efficient and attentive. We, of course, had to take some time at the end to figure out the bill with credit cards and cash - annoying, yes, but it's going to happen with large groups. The main server was getting more and more visibly annoyed which was kind of offputting but understandable. We ended up leaving after brunch, walking around a bit and then stopping back in for a drink downstairs. We loved the bartender and enjoyed watching some baseball. There's a giant fireplace in the middle of the dining room downstairs that we definitely want to come back and visit during the winter months!"

Our server was working on the patio yet had to take two tables in the complete opposite side of the restaurant! Why? It's not like there was only one server on...A manager then had to help her, running food and drinks to the table. This is not the first time I have noticed or experienced this at this establishment. I have seen ONE bartender be in charge of the bar,  and have about 12 tables in the bar area. I have seen servers' tables be scattered across the restaurant in different sections. It's unfair to the servers but also doesn't make for a pleasant visit. From having worked in restaurants in the past, I suggest corporate shows management how to properly divvy up tables and how to do their job."

My boyfriend politely waited for me to get my meal, but it took at least 20 minutes during which time I told my boyfriend to start eating so his food wouldn't get cold. That's when he saw a thick, black hair inside his food. We could not believe this. The supervising staff came over and apologized with a ""it happens"" comment.

There was nobody at the check-in counter for an hour.  There were hardly 3 people serving the tables and they just don't care about you. When you call out for them, they make a face and ask you to wait. They gave us a table after waiting for more than an hour. Then the service was terrible. Then they started getting us wrong orders and dishes. Food is above average and some dish looked like they were made for the heck of it and the person serving was rude, making faces each time. 

My friends told me that the restaurant is much better during the day. Then if this horrible service is a night time problem, then I advise the restaurant to please replace your night staff and hire people who are nice and don't discriminate. 

After the experience I doubt I would visit the restaurant again as there are plenty of other better options out there."

We waited 30m and she did not even bring us water let alone take our order.  Instead we got to listen to her loudly complain about customers to other customers.  We ended up going to the village cafe in Newton which is AMAZING.  People of Walmart type of experience though if you like that kinda thing. "

Cook lost our order... that's what they told us after 45 minutes of waiting. We asked for the manager, he cut us off before we finished speaking and walked away. He never came back to the table. The waiter comes an hour later claiming that she thought it was coming out (Jessica). The food finally came out and it was all wrong. 
No one offered any compensation for the horrible customer service. The waiter directed us to the manager who was missing in action. Worse service ever!!!!"

The employees and OWNER are the most disrespectful and rudest people I have ever met!!!I wouldn’t go there unless you don’t care about being treated with hospitality and basic manners. These people don’t care about you and SHOW it!! THE OWNER GOT IN MY FRIENDS FACE AND SCREAMED AT HER  for eating a snack she didn’t buy there! Not to mention the FILTHIEST rag on him that he wouldn’t keep his distance with!! He is CHILDISH and  THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL MAN I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED!!! Other employees tried to INSULT my friend for even showing up there! My other friend asked him a simple question in a polite way and he screamed in her face TOO and tried to tell her to not come back!! The people working there now have RUINED the Big A and it’s good name! I feel bad for the previous owners who worked so hard to manage the place because now it is no longer a nice establishment in Malden:( They all need SERIOUS TRAINING ON HOSPITALITY and to just learn how to talk and approach people in general. They need to treat every person who walks through the door like a customer or that person NEVER WILL BE! They just lost a loyal customer who’s family had been going there for over 10 years...until I met the new owners. It ‘s just sad. Now their food is sloppy and no care goes into it. The tables are all dirty and chairs have food left on it. I sat down to lunch and got CHOCOLATE ON MY PANTS THAT WASN’T MINE!!!! The owner was very eager to yell at us but when they see us cleaning our own table not an ounce of movement from any staff to offer a rag or even to clean it themselves. I’ve gotten better service from an ice cream truck than this place. I honestly feel bad for anyone who has to go through the treatment that I received from them. I hope my review helps anyone to steer clear from this place because I honestly don’t even feel safe knowing they are still able to treat people with their indecency:("

Other staff members would SHAKE THEIR HEADS AT US just for being there. My family has been going to the Big A OVER 10 YEARS and this is how they treat a loyal customer! I would NEVER RECOMMEND this place to anyone who wants to be treated with basic respect and hospitality. THIS IS NOT A RESTAURANT!! They should honestly be shut down because on top of all of that their food isn’t even good. They are in No Position to be kicking people out when they can’t even put cheese on pizza without it falling off. I’ve also gotten a sandwich that was supposed to be hot and was FROZEN when I received it!!!

If you take a dish they circle some code on their asian looking bingo card. One of the options was chicken FEET! I think i saw a pork dish but it was all fat. This place is setup like the chow hall at Ellis Island. I dont know what this place was before but i saw a stage in the back. It was on a weekend and parking was a nightmare.

The place is set back from the road across from the golden arches. There is a parking lot. The food seems like pretty standard American food selections. My burger was good and I had it with a beer from a better than average draft selection. The fries left something to be desired. My wife had a Cobb salad which came layered like a parfait in a large mason jar. She thought it was cute but I thought it was impractical. I guess we see the world differently. They have a kids menu and the wagon wheel pasta was a hit. Sports were on a couple of TVs around the restaurant. I am sure I will visit again at some point and I will give the ol' burger and fries another try and maybe revisit the rating. To me fries are important.

The website boasts 20 beers on draft but actually there are only 12. The menu is limited and the prices are offensive. Not to mention, unless you're eating Raman noodles at an upscale Raman restaurant, who wants pork belly? The pretend flatbread is a joke. Go to Anthony's for a real pizza for $2 more. Finally, the last straw was being told that a 7% beer could only be poured in a tumbler glass due to its alcohol content. Excuse me? I will just go to any other bar on Earth that pours pints. No matter what. Oh and what's up with the temperature? Hotter inside than it is outside with an entire front-facing bar with windows that do not open?!

Very odd that you get your food including a burger and fries but you have to ask for ketchup!  If it was hand made and fresh, maybe... But cooking a frozen patty, in front of the customer and then making them ask for condiments?  It's ok. Fix some of the operational problems and it'd be great. "

The owners need to focus more on the details of the overall dining experience for customers, or this new restaurant is going to be in trouble. Noisy shouting of orders to the line cooks is continuously disturbing to conversation. Our waitress was rehearsed and nervous; hopefully she will settle in with more time. A good Cesar salad is not that hard to make; if you say on the menu that it includes egg, why would you not be clear and say that it is soft boiled (and deep fried?)? My wife's meal was tasty, but the portion was ridiculously small. Having an open kitchen is a great idea if the staff is trained to be engaging with the customers at the bar seats; in our experience this was not the case. Too expensive for what we got overall, in our opinion. We will wait a couple months at least before we go back and give it another try."

"Max Brenner","745 Boylston St, Boston, MA 02116, USA",4,2,"Alison Kan",1503322052,"a month ago",3,"The food was good. The chicken cheese steak waffle (with cocoa dusted waffle fries) was good but nothing too special. The waffle itself was thin and could have been a little thicker or crispier to give the sandwich more structure and make it easier to pick up. The waffle fries dusted with cocoa were a fun novelty, but tasted pretty normal. The make your own sundae included good chocolate drops and milk chocolate, as well as whipped cream, a waffle cone, and sprinkles, but it was a little too sweet for my taste and not necessarily worth $10. Overall, the service was great and it's a fun place to try with friends and family, but not everything is worth the price on the menu. Still, I might just come back to try some of their other desserts."

Hot tapas, small in quantity, were all tasty. We particularly liked the mushrooms medley, eel don, salmon teriyaki don, and the Sousaku sushi pizza.  In each of the two dons, the rice, perfectly cooked,  made the difference. The pizza's crispy fried rice base was the invention of this restaurant; it enhanced the pleasure of biting into this delicious pizza. 

This restaurant obviously is not for diners who look for good eating with generous portion. 

The place was clean and the waitstaff attentive and efficient. But the parking is limited and inconvenient. "

They could use a few more staff members, it seemed like they're getting good business. A few fellas behind the counter were very nice, checking up on orders as the carryout customers waited. 

The location is franchised, so while the pizza is local the money that goes into it goes back into the community. The pizza is cheap and good, which for my budget fits in perfectly.

As for the pizza, it's Papa Johns so the pizza doesn't change location to location."

Some items are a must here like the buttermilk biscuits and the fried smashed potatoes. The fried chicken could be good if they would add more flavor. The sprinkle of sea salt they add on top of the bland chicken doesn't do much. The brisket sometimes has a weird chemically smell like lighter fuel. Occassionally it is good though. The smoked shredded chicken is okay. Better for lunch or brunch than dinner as the options are very limited."

They carry Gluten Free soy sauce and are wonderfully accommodating for  those of use with food allergies. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.

"Bertucci's","22 Merchants Row, Boston, MA 02109, USA",3.6,2,"Jack Street",1500561796,"2 months ago",1,"MOTHERS, FATHERS, FAMILIES BEWARE!! ""Kid-friendly""??! Not in the least. I had a terrible experience last week at this location and emailed Bertucci's corporate office immediately after returning home. This it has been almost a week and I still haven't gotten a response from anyone. I am still shocked by my experience and decided to let everyone know, especially people with children, how I was treated at this so called ""kid friendly"" restaurant. I was unable to share my email I sent due to its length. Long story short, after sitting down and ordering food, my two year old son had a tantrum and after not being able to calm him down, I took him outside for a walk in his stroller where he fell asleep. When I returned, the manager told me I could not bring my son in the stroller back to our table because the stroller was a fire hazard. Her solutions for me were to leave my party (of 6) and sit alone at a different table near the front. Or that I could take my food To-Go and leave. I was so stressed out after my sons tantrum and having to spend twenty minutes outside walking around to get him to sleep. I couldn't believe that the manager gave me such a hard time. Ultimately, my server was happy to accommodate us and moved our seats and made room at our table for my sons stroller. By the time I got to eat my food, it was cold. Had I not been held up at the front of the restaurant by the manager, I would have had a hot meal. The manager never apologized. And I can't believe corporate hasn't reached out to me to make things right. There was plenty of space for the stroller, completely out of the way of foot traffic. The stroller was no bigger than a wheelchair. Does this establishment not allow handicap people in wheelchairs because wheelchairs are fire hazards? I'm still shocked. Never been treated this way in my life."

Management seems to not be experienced to know that many sandwich and salad restaurants in the area close on those types of days (before and after holidays) driving many non customers to Bertuccis and they consistently fail at staffing and the ability to properly serve lunch timely and quickly. Typically a decent place for lunch but they do struggle to get you in and out within an hour. Food is solid and staff is friendly. Management may need to be trained or have more experience. "

Hopefully, they will work to improve their menu items."

Place was moderately busy, but not hectic. Seated within a minute. We ordered boneless wings, enchilada, Mac n cheese and a burger. Food came out in a timely manner and our server did a great job  bringing water out to us. The wings,Mac n cheese and enchiladas were tasty, however, ALL the sauces were runny with a ""watered down"" feel.

I think we were seated in 15 mins, at most. Our seats gave us the view of all the theater district madness (I like to people watch). Our server Alicia was nice, attentive, and made good recommendations. The food was pretty good, this place great for socializing with friends, and happy hour. Definitely plan on going back soon."

We sat at the bar and the bartender asked her if we were having food. She relied "" no just drinks"" he said "" I can't sever your friend ,she's had enough tonight"" WHAT! I don't drink and was completely sober! She tried to explain I was the designated driver, but he walked away! Ironically, my friend was completely trashed and he served her! 
   Of course the whole bar heard the interaction and had to comment. It was completely humiliating, uncalled for and insulting! As a former cocktail waitress myself, this bartender needs to be retrained in spotting intoxicated customers. I will never return!"

But went at night and it was a totally different experience... the waitress with bright red hair was extremely rude. First my party and I ordered drinks at the bar, but we decided to close our tabs and get appetizers and drinks at a table. So we asked the host if we could sit at a table that was open. He said yes and when the waitress came over to my group she asked us to get up from her table when we wanted service. We explained that the drinks in our hands were paid for and that we wanted to get a menu to order drinks and apps. She said that she would get us a menu but never came back. When I approached her asking if she was still going to come over (after about 25 minutes) with a menu, she rudely explained that she couldn't ring in anything at the computers and that she wasn't our waitress even though she was the one to come over to us in the first place. Instead of coming over and explaining we were just ignored and she walked by us several times swearing underneath her breath. Extremely unprofessional."

Dish by dish breakdown:
Foie gras terrine: served with a sort of raisin toast, an apple sauce, and a simple salad, the former 3 we ate together. I'm not a huge foie gras fan but the dish was very nice. The apple sauce in particular is excellent and the restaurant uses it for a variety of dishes.

Cod: every aspect of this dish was outstanding. The cod is super fresh and cooked to flaky, melt-in-your-mouth perfection. The accompanying garnishes work together with perfect synergy. Probably the best fish dish I've had for at least a year.

Beef bourguignon: the better of two Boston implementations of this classic that I've had. The sauce is very savory and I think serving the dish with basmati rice is an excellent touch, with the aromatic rice melding with the flavor of the sauce. Definitely better than potatoes! Some parts of the beef were a little dry, but the sauce kind of took care of that.

Tartine au chocolat: I've had better chocolate lava cakes in my time, but this one was still pretty good; would still try a different dessert next time. I feel like they could use more/better chocolate.

Altogether, 4.5 stars. Rounded up to 5 because the cod entree was so memorable."

I've been here many times since they've opened but her attitude seems to get worse each time. I think she got demoted or something since she doesn't take orders (said we have to ask the dim sum ladies) & all she did today was clean & set the tables, which she is lucky to still have a job after these last few months of poor performance IMHO.

Today, while cleaning another table next to my seat, she splashed stuff onto my jacket, which I wasn't aware of until I was done with dim sum. These people should owe me a dry clean for their negligence."

We tried 4 ales and all were good. But the food is mediocre at best. We had 2 pizzas and both were terribly chewy and salty. The only good part was their cheese board.
Their approach to self-seating the patrons is weird. I can imagine that there may be quite a bit of tension on a busy night. We got lucky since we scouted the hall and quite quickly spotted a couple ready to leave, and there was nobody waiting for them, so we sort of hang on them. However while we were waiting 3 more groups of people came in and they were out of luck and had to compete for the spots. I don't think that helps to improve the experience.
They have quite big parking lot although it's a bit of walking.
The price of the growlers is really good, so I bought 2 different ales and will definitely come back. However I really doubt that we would stay for another dinner, and would not recommend it to anyone."

The place is noisy and busy. 

Although they have multiple ramps to get in, there isn't really much wheelchair accessible seating. It is either the aforementioned benches or tall tables which mean that your drink is at the level of your nose.

Mandarin King makes the ""American-style"" food that most of us are familiar and comfortable with -- there's nothing fancy here -- but what sets them apart from the crowd for me is the freshness of the ingredients and preparation.

The vegetables are super crisp/fresh and the fried rice feels like it's cooked to order.

My favorite dishes are the veggie lo mein, fried rice & spicy string beans. I swear I could eat 5 orders of those beans."

It was cozy but bustling; it was trendy but of no particular style.  The bread and pesto brought to every table was phenomenal.  The small, fresh menu selection was easy to swallow.  Even ordering two simple things such as mussels and Greek salad, the portions were robust and the flavor to match.  Stayed for 3 hours, tipped 50%."

Also knew a wait was in order for a busy Saturday night.  However, we were ignored and passed over many times to just place our name for a table.  Our wait was double the time as suggested, yet others entered the restaurant and were seated immediately (groups of 2 to 8), as we overheard non-reservation requests to dine. There were open tables but was told they could not combine tables to accommodate our party of 6 due to policies.  Once seated, apologies were given for our treatment and delay.  Orders taken soon after seating; however not all meals were served at the same time...one was at least 5 minutes after the rest of the party... and one order ( house evening special) was ice cold.  The cold meal was returned and removed from the bill after such request.  Maybe our experience was all just an anomaly because of a busy Saturday night...but overall a frustrating disappointment with very little compassion given from the business side of the equation!  Boston's restaurant scene is vibrant and can be an awesome dining experience as seen during our week stay.  From my dining point of view- Legal Seafood Boston is overrated and overpriced with poor customer service from the very beginning to leaving the door."

I admit that the food here is okay/good but the service is just too bad, at least this is what I experienced: 6 of us chose to sit at 2 small tables at the corner but the waitress keep telling us to sit in the middle of the hall. This could be a kind notification but I don't think we did something wrong by having our own preference. HOWEVER, here comes the annoying part: They then tell us that the corner tables are hard for the food cart to get in and we might be ignored and hope we don't complain about this part. FINE, this is okay, I can still walk to the cart and order some food when the it is close by. BUT when people are waiting at the doorway, the waitress came frequently and keep asking if we will order more, if not, we should leave. WTH??? Is this how they treat the customers? Having dim-sum is a way of leisure and I pay for the service, the food and the time of JOY as I stayed there. I understand they try to earn a lot of money by rotating more rounds of customers, but this shouldn't be an excuse to kick other customers away. Don't tell me they won't serve each of us if we separate into 6 different tables and of course, we are paying the same amount of tips. Despite that, some people who don't speak Mandarin or Cantonese are also ignored because having dim-sum is different than ordering food by the menu. They don't know this and none of the waiter/waitress guide them. It ends with sth like this: A family of 6 left by eating one dish. Once again, the food is okay, but I do hope they train their staff better before serving as a real restaurant who takes tips by offering rudeness. This is ridiculous."

The place looks pretty nice, but it is a bit cramped. The tables are pretty close together. There is a VIP room and a small bar area by the entrance. I found the restroom doors pretty unique; unlike many restroom doors where the door would cover the whole entrance, these doors only covered about 50% of the entrance.

The host said we would need to wait 10 minutes. Several other partial parties were seated with friends who were waiting (as in their parties weren't complete and they got seated).  We stood for 30 more minutes as the only people waiting. There was an open 4 top and then another and still we were denied a table. I get that 4 tops aren't for 2 but how long do 2 guests need to stand and wait on a quiet weeknight?  If two tables stand open I'm pretty sure you are making 0$ off both of them."

The patio is wonderful in the warmer months and the dining room is cozy, warm, and welcoming during the cooler months.

In addition to normal dining I have also had the pleasure to host several events at The Black Sheep and I can say that the staff here is far and away the easiest and most accommodating group of professionals that I have dealt with. Santos the Restaurant Manager is always happy to help and will go out of his way to make sure that everything is always perfect. Additionally, the staff that we have during our events, Odair and Viviane, are beyond helpful and are a lot of fun. 

I would highly recommend The Black Sheep for dinner, lunch, and especially to host your next event. Santos and his staff are a cut above the rest."

We popped in around 6pm on a Saturday night. I ordered the ribs and the pimento cheese. My guy ordered the fried alligator and the gumbo.  He said he liked his food. He didn't love it. It was his first time trying alligator and he said it was okay, chewy, but probably wouldn't order it again. Not the restaurant's fault at all. Everything was presented nicely. My ribs were a little too dry and overdone.  I didn't care for the sauce slathered over ribs, I favor  a dry rub with sauce on the side. It was quite sweet. I also didn't care for the collard greens. I'm no collard green expert, but I prefer a more smoky, less sweet/vinegary version. Again, personal taste. The mashed potatoes were outstanding. I didn't love that I couldn't get a diet soda either. I don't drink alcohol and water or sugared drinks were my only option other than water. Our waiter didn't offer us dessert, so I can't even say what was on the menu. All in all, I was disappointed. I had high hopes, and the mashed potatoes were the only bite that I loved."

I went to dinner with my friend and her parents, who are Indian, and they were treated so horribly. The reservation was made in my name but when my friend gave it -I was a bit back talking with her father- the owner looked her up and down and tried to say there was so reservation until I came up and questioned what was going on.The waitress was rude and only spoke to me, ignoring them entirely. We tipped accordingly and I hoped it would be done and it wouldn't ruin our nice trip. However, she chased us out onto the sidewalk to demand to know what the tip was for. I told her it was due to her service and she proceeded to look at my friend and her wonderful, loving, kind mother and gave them the dirtiest look and said "" It's in their nature. The blacks.""

1. The main lady who runs this place is extremely rude. All of the other younger male bus staff were very friendly but to be in the service industry and to have a extremely bad attitude doesn’t seem right. Lady do something else if you’re not happy.
2. We just got back from Rome and wanted authentic Pasta Carbonara. If you search google or yelp people suggest this is the place to go. NO. It was terrible as well as the other four dishes we ordered. Store bought pasta with store bought Alfredo sauce is not authentic Italian. It is embarrassing that all of our meals had store bought pasta that was over cooked. The red sauce tasted like Prego. My humble suggestion, sell your location to someone who cares about the food and will make homemade pasta and sauce.
3. We waited way too long for our food. We watched three tables come in, be sat, get food, finish, and close out before we had plates. We were only a four top so there is no logical reason for that.
Unfortunately the North End has a handful of places like this that stay alive by the unsuspecting tourists. Fair warning."
"Bella Vista","288 Hanover St, Boston, MA 02113, USA",3.8,2,"Gunjan Mehta",1502220928,"a month ago",1,"I had the most terrible, racist experience dining at this restaurant last week. Our server chased us down and said, 'It is in their nature not to tip....the blacks.'

I called ahead to make a reservation at this place thinking it was Saturday in Boston. My family, a friend and I arrived a little early and the host was a rude, stand offish man, who did not pay attention to me when I told him about the reservation. That is, until my friend spoke up. My friend is Caucasian and I am south Asian. 

We got seated and woman came over for our order. My glass was dirty so I requested that she change it and she grunted, clearly displeased by that request. The service was very poor. She came over twice, once to take our order and once to serve us. Each time she was frustrated and rude with us. We felt unwelcome in their establishment and decided that the service did not deserve a generous tip. As we walked towards the door to leave, the woman chased my friend down and asked her about the tip. My friend politely said that the food was good but the service wasn't. She then looked at my mom and I and said that it was in our nature not to tip...the blacks. This was the first time she made eye contact with us. Appalled at what she had said we walked back to our car in horror.

Our experience with this horrible place does not end here. We found out later, that we were greeted by Anthony, the owner of the establishment. And his mother, Lucy was our server. We called the next day and asked for an apology. We were directed to a lawyer who accused us of not paying. 

Mr. Anthony, yes we paid for our meal which included a tip that was certainly not deserved considering the service we received and the verbal abuse that followed. And no, the amount we tipped was not because of the color of my skin. It was because of the most unpleasant experience we ever had. Just for your reference, I am attaching a photo of our receipt."

Very modern, the staff is great, there's a restaurant, Starbucks, bar, and gift shop in the lobby. The hotel is located downtown so you're close to lots of restaurants and shops in the area. My only complaint is although the rooms are beautiful and modern; they're so small! I couldn't imagine coming here with a significant other bc the rooms would not fit two people. Other than that, wonderful hotel!"

Yes, the bathroom is small, but the room itself was outstanding. It seems like the hotel underwent a very extensive renovation and the rooms are very trendy. I enjoyed the comfortable bed and the technology in the room. The room allowed you to cast via the Google Chrome app, which was a highlight for me. You have access to the rail system within walking distance, which was perfect for us. Service was outstanding and I enjoyed the mix of a historic hotel with a modern feel. I recommend this hotel based on my experience. We had the queen-size room with one bed. The room did have a fridge and a k-cup machine. "

2nd time here for breakfast, the food was good, and everyone was really nice.... Except one extremely rude middle aged waitress. I was there with my baby and a friend. I paid and went to get my tray to go sit down but the cashier offered to take it for me. She actually asked someone else to take it for me behind the counter but they refused so she did. She was very nice to do that, and much appreciated. Come to find out the other lady behind the counter that refused, bad mouthed me and my baby to the next person in line, which happened to be my friend. She said people with kids just can't do anything for themselves these days. And something else that I won't post here. I didn't ask for help. I appreciated it though. I probably won't recommend this place to anyone with kids. "

We picked The Restaurant completely at random and, boy, am I glad that we did! The staff was incredibly nice, the DJ was super fun (it was music bingo night) and even the other customers were really friendly. We did get our burgers, which were really good and reasonably priced for what you get. The patties here are huge in area, like a pancake, but not super thick. It's tricky to eat but it cooks really evenly (I got medium-rare and it was spot-on). All things considered, I would definitely recommend this place, and will probably be coming back to check out their breakfast as well."

Even though it was my fault. The staff is fantastic , amazing. Great customer service. Thank you Julio for a delicious meal and a wonderful experience.

This one lazy guy helped me once( I ordered online) , he went to grab me the bread buns, I asked for 10 (as my co workers wanted some) , gave me 3 with no oil or butter. I didn't check the bag until I got back to work and since he just asked me how many do I want and if I want butter with it, I thought he put everything in the bag.
But some other time , Christopher helped me and he gave me extra buns and he was very nice and funny.
So I guess depends of what kind of people you get to deal with.
One thing: if you like caramelized onions, add that to your pizza! (Soooo good)"

Now imagine you are hungry, late for something, and take a detour off the highway as this is the last chance you have to get something to eat for a four hours.  Every moment you are in line is a moment that people are waiting for you to show up elsewhere. 

Now sit in that confusing line for nine minutes only to hear 'one moment sir"" while other people are trying to give their order to someone in the back booth.

Davio's offers an excellent variety of dining options and some of the best steak I have ever had. I highly recommend the 18 oz. Ribeye, the Kobe beef meatballs, the truffle fries and spring roll sampler. The service was excellent and prompt. My only complaint was the female bartenders were starring at us in a very odd manner at random times during the meal. Very strange behavior teetering on rude.

We tried the pre-fixed dining out menu on a Monday afternoon.  Two of us ordered grilled chicken on mushroom risotto and the other ordered roasted chicken.  The meal was average and very expensive.  I have had better meals at local family restaurants in my town for 1/4 the cost.  Our bill was approx $100. We had arugula salads, chicken, dessert, no coffee or cocktails.  The dessert was good but unfortunately, the overall experience was a 2."

Pity they stopped the shuck for a buck as it's now 2$ per oyster. Oysters were good.

It was going to happen, just depended on where.  My coworker who preceded me into the city made reservations here, and I quickly agreed.

We started off at the bar with a couple beers and some oysters.  Hell yes oysters.  Hell. Yes.  They were fresh, tasty, nice and cool, and were just wonderful.

We moved into the dining room when our table was ready.  A bit funny that we arrived early for a reservation and they told us to come back at 7pm when it was to be ready.  Throughout the whole meal, the dining room was never even close to half full; curious why they didn't want to seat us when we arrived early, but no matter.

Had a wonderful server, who was professional, polite, prompt, and courteous throughout.

My chowder was hot and tasty.  The bread was plentiful and did well with some butter.  The salad was a bit on the bitter side.  I went with the whole fish, which while good overall, had a bit of a sour taste that became overwhelming as I progressed through it.

Finished with a scotch and a full belly of pretty tasty food overall.

I left pleased."

I had the scallops and my uncle and I shared the combo meat and cheese board. Let me just say, that while the initial sticker shock of 35 dollars is a lot, you certainly get your money's worth! We were almost too full from that to finish dinner! I really enjoyed the scallops with the parsnip puree, but did find that a lot of the accompanying vegetables were undercooked to the point of being impossible to chew.

I don't remember what my wife got but she was happy with her meal so I decided to give then a second chance.

Fast forward to today, my wife and I decided to go there for Brunch. We ordered the Eggs and Hash from their menu and we were both very disappointed.

1. They advertised that they have home-made hash, but what we got tasted like canned hash.

2. Their portions were very minimalistic compared to how much they charged.

3. Their home-fries were good but only due to the fact that they were tossed and fried in butter, it is all that I could taste and my plate was so greasy.

All things considered, I don't believe in third chances..."

Over-seasoned and very garlicky. The owner is a greedy selfish man who only looks out for himself. Not a community kind of person. We found him to be very rude. I would never go back there. "

Don't be intimidated by the always full parking lot. Place can be packed full but still can give you the best service you can get , at a top quality Irish restaurant......"
