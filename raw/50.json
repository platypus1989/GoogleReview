He said yes and when the waitress came over to my group she asked us to get up from her table when we wanted service. We explained that the drinks in our hands were paid for and that we wanted to get a menu to order drinks and apps. She said that she would get us a menu but never came back. When I approached her asking if she was still going to come over (after about 25 minutes) with a menu, she rudely explained that she couldn't ring in anything at the computers and that she wasn't our waitress even though she was the one to come over to us in the first place.
