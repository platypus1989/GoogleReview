Move along folks. The logo even bears a striking resemblance to the Longhorn's chain restaurant. (Side note: the world will never know the glory of my original review due to Yelp's mobile app glitching out deleting my draft review!) My sweet SO wanted to take me out to a nice place to eat while also finally using up our Phantom Gourmet gift card, which is surprisingly difficult partly because the website list of restaurants is not up to date. He found this restaurant and it seemed promising with all these positive reviews, so he also called ahead of time just to confirm that the gift card would be accepted. A misinformed individual erroneously affirmed that we could use it, so we couldn't wait to get there! \n\nUpon arrival, we asked again about the our reservation and the gift card however the hosts were singing a different tune. They needed to check with management. Much to our dismay they told us that they were featured on Phantom Gourmet, but they do not accept their gift cards with a halfhearted apology. Well what a waste of driving here, but we were hungry so they had us by the stomach. The host lead us to a strange location sandwiched in between the noisy bar and a booth, which was later filled with a larger group.\n\nOne point of pride that I cannot deny the restaurant was the top notch holiday decor. As we entered, there were 2 life size nutcracker statues along with various lights strewn all over the walls. In the main area they also have a large tree, Santa with presents, a fire place and more festive tidings everywhere.\n\nOur waiter was a courteous gentleman who gave us a solid appetizer recommendation for the Steak Tartare at $15. However, as soon as the other tables with larger groups filled next to us, his attention quickly diverted to them. Also anyway you slice it, I can't imagine any area of the restaurant being romantic since it all wraps around this huge noisy bar in the center. As for the main course, I ordered their signature burger with sweet potato fries and was sorely disappointed with the sheer lack of flavor at ~$14-15 especially compared to a Black Iron Burger or even Shake Shack. This was also the cheapest entree on the menu... and everything else is closer to the $20+ mark. My SO ordered their full rack of ribs at $24 with regular fries, which were tastier but still not worth the price tag. At least the food was ready quickly as we finished up sooner than expected. I couldn't wait to finish up and continue on with our night of errands.", "relative_time_description": "a week ago", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107411977737710070420/reviews", "time": 1506377542, "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-lyBO65WUCi8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAe4/gJp5Z-b5u1k/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg"}, {"rating": 5, "author_name": "Adam Krueckeberg", "language": "en", "text": "Always fantastic.
