It was almost as cold inside and I had to keep my coat on during my meal. Don't expect fruit toppings like the pictures in this listing because they don't offer them. They don't carry real maple syrup either or any flavored syrups other than your everyday corn syrup. From where I was sitting, I had a view into the kitchen through an open door and it didn't exactly encourage my appetite. The one waitress in the place was a bit rude and inattentive, only brought me 2 eggs when I ordered 3, and as we were leaving, covered a sneeze with her hand, then went directly to handling customer orders without washing her hands.
