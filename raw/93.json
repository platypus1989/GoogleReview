A bit funny that we arrived early for a reservation and they told us to come back at 7pm when it was to be ready.  Throughout the whole meal, the dining room was never even close to half full; curious why they didn't want to seat us when we arrived early, but no matter.\n\nHad a wonderful server, who was professional, polite, prompt, and courteous throughout.\n\nMy chowder was hot and tasty.  The bread was plentiful and did well with some butter.  The salad was a bit on the bitter side.
