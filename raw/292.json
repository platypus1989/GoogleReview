lunch and although I've been there many times, it's almost always been for dinner.

I sat at the bar as I was alone, first time I've ever done that since the place opened about 20 years ago. The bartender was professional, polite and personable. It didn't hurt that she was very easy on eyes. I shared a story about noticing the new sign they put up about a year ago and noticing that I didn't like it but I never noticed that the new sign also had a new name, she agreed with me and confessed she still uses the old name. It went from \"The Inn At Bay Pointe\" to \"The Bay Pointe Waterfront Restaurant\", not a big deal, same ownership.\n\nOverall, great place.
