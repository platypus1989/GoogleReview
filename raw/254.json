The doors are very shabby and in need of a paint job. And there is no one waiting to greet you. We walked by 3 people who totally ignored us before someone seated us.

It has a lot of potential, but the service is less than satisfactory!  I don't like making negative reviews but if I didn't have to wait 25 minutes to even have a server approach us I'd be happy. You can't get good service therefore not many people seem to be in there anymore during the week.  Last time I went was with my aunt and a few family members the first week of January, and our service was less than acceptable.  The time before that visit we waited for someone to seat us for five minutes (with NO ONE in the place).  Then when seated for 20 minutes no one came over so we finally got up and left.  \n\nAs I said it's a great place with lots of potential so not sure what has been going on the last 1-2 years, but that's my experience during that time. Again it's a great location, but management and service needs a lot of work. People (including myself) would starting coming again if there were some positive changes.
