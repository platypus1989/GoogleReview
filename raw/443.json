Great layout with a great chef's bar that faces the kitchen. I got the burger and it was ok. Mostly because it was frozen when they put it on the grill!  Also came with no condiments. Very odd that you get your food including a burger and fries but you have to ask for ketchup!  If it was hand made and fresh, maybe... But cooking a frozen patty, in front of the customer and then making them ask for condiments?  It's ok. Fix some of the operational problems and it'd be great.

The owners need to focus more on the details of the overall dining experience for customers, or this new restaurant is going to be in trouble. Noisy shouting of orders to the line cooks is continuously disturbing to conversation. Our waitress was rehearsed and nervous; hopefully she will settle in with more time. A good Cesar salad is not that hard to make; if you say on the menu that it includes egg, why would you not be clear and say that it is soft boiled (and deep fried?)? My wife's meal was tasty, but the portion was ridiculously small. Having an open kitchen is a great idea if the staff is trained to be engaging with the customers at the bar seats; in our experience this was not the case. Too expensive for what we got overall, in our opinion.
