I come from a large Sicilian family. So when I proposed we try Comella's to my group of friends I really looked foolish when I came away with nothing but regrets and empty wallets. \n\nLet me break the entire meal down for you. I ordered stuffed shells. When I ordered stuffed shells I couldn't hear the woman over the phone correctly and it had turned she asked if I had wanted ziti with it. I said sure because I had no idea you put ziti with stuffed shells because that's already a pasta. What I received for 9.50 was two stuffed shells of normal size and about 75% of the container was ziti. That is technically stuffed shells as there were 2. The taste was middling and inoffensive.\n\nMy fiance ordered fettuccine Alfredo which seemed to be white sauce plopped unceremoniously atop dry fettucine. She mixed in the sauce herself. The taste is middling and inoffensive. \n\nMy best friend ordered a chicken and onion pizza. That cost him 6 dollars for just the chicken. How much chicken you might ask. Around 50 cents of tasteless crumbles. The layer cheese was so thin it seemed like pinkish skin with red tomato blood through. The entire pizza cost roughly 15 dollars for what any other place might charge a hard nine. The taste was middling and inoffensive. \n\nMy best friend's girlfriend described her sandwich as tasting more like the salad dressing than the ingredients. It cost 5.99 which wasn't horrible. The price was middling and inoffensive. \n\nMy roommate ordered a cheeseless pizza as he has a dairy allergy. Thankfully Comella's remembered this. However the rest of chicken and red pepper pizza was unimpressive. The middle was not cooked and the dough seemed melt to the box. The pervasive issue of a 6 dollar topping of chicken continued on here. The taste was middling and inoffensive.\n\nMy roommates wife ordered Taylor Tuesday which is a pizza combo consisting of mozzarella and basil for 13 dollars. The taste was middling and inoffensive.\n\nOverall if you're looking to waste money on inferior food and poor service then Comella's is perfect for you. I'd highly suggest spending your money at any other pizzeria in Newton, especially West Newton Pizza Market. Despite being owned by Egyptians it seems that they understand the Italian way far better than signore Comella.", "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116171953554446378729/reviews", "time": 1500078952, "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-phuWoh-5G9A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACs/2nTFFzt62UE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg"}, {"rating": 5, "author_name": "Thomas Carruth", "language": "en", "text": "Steak Bomb and chicken ceaser wrap were  awesome.
