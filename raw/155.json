I had decided to take my fianc\u00e9 for her birthday as she had never been. The main dining hall was and always has been a beautiful place to dine. The ambiance and the food were both amazing per usual. However the service was beyond atrocious. Our waiter (Kyle) was inattentive, forgot to bring us things that we ordered or asked for as acompaniments for our meal. We had made an open table reservation (under Dean M) and put in our reservation that we were celebrating her birthday and upon arrival again asked if we could have something brought out with a candle, which was never brought out. Also when asked for our food to be to go, it was never brought out to us. Please make it a point to train the staff in proper etiquette when before we were done ordering our waiter brought us our bill. Upon speaking to the manager (her name begins with an M and escapes me at the moment) she was equally as dismissive as our waiter was the entire. What should have been a celebration of great company, amazing food, and wonderful ambiance was ruined by extremely poor service and dismissive management.
