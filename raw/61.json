Great beers, a lot of them. We tried 4 ales and all were good. But the food is mediocre at best. We had 2 pizzas and both were terribly chewy and salty. The only good part was their cheese board.\nTheir approach to self-seating the patrons is weird. I can imagine that there may be quite a bit of tension on a busy night. We got lucky since we scouted the hall and quite quickly spotted a couple ready to leave, and there was nobody waiting for them, so we sort of hang on them. However while we were waiting 3 more groups of people came in and they were out of luck and had to compete for the spots. I don't think that helps to improve the experience.\nThey have quite big parking lot although it's a bit of walking.\nThe price of the growlers is really good, so I bought 2 different ales and will definitely come back. However I really doubt that we would stay for another dinner, and would not recommend it to anyone.", "relative_time_description": "a week ago", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114813701356596360374/reviews", "time": 1506389104, "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-b57jkbFvoGs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAASM/gIFrQuR3veE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg"}, {"rating": 5, "author_name": "Dave Edel", "language": "en", "text": "Great fun place to enjoy many different brews and good food.
