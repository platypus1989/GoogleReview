Greeted by the Valet like an old friend, always a smile at the hostess station and they are so thoughtful to save my favorite table\u2026 Moment later my server Eddie arrives and we start talking life and food\u2026 In that order. Eddie knows the menu an is always on point with just the right recommendations. When I come here they know, Eddies my guy. Moments later Hoshang the General Manager comes to Welcome me.\n\nEddie\u2019s first recommendation\u2026 The Salmon Tartare\u2026 Tossed with diced Mango, jalape\u00f1o, Shallots, Olive Oil, Lemon Juice over a Cilantro Crema . And add in a slight drizzle of Herbed Oil , Shaved Radish, Pickled Chanterelle Mushrooms alongside a house made Brioche\u2026 This is a light appetizer that comes alive on your palate.. The jalape\u00f1o adds in a slight kick which the Cilantro Crema offsets. Magical!. \n\nEdie\u2019s second recommendation\u2026 The Piedmont Beef\u2026 A 10 Oz Flat Iron Steak, Sweet Potato Crema, Charred Cipollini Onions topped with a wonderful Au Poivre\u2026 You\u2019d think I used a squeegee to clean the plate! Steak, a perfect pink center medium\u2026 Onions, charred to perfection. I don\u2019t really eat onions, my wife will concur. Au Poivre is something that every chef prepares a little different. They way Chef Alex does it puts the \u201cO\u201d in OMG!\n\nI wasn\u2019t going to order dessert but good luck. with that with Eddie\u2026 Chocolate Crema\u2026 Semi-Sweet Chocolate Mousse, Chantilli Cream paired with an Espresso Biscotti. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say it\u2019s as good as the ones my Italian mother-in-law and I make at home. Wow!\n\nAnd as usual I cap it off with my signature Cappuccino\u2026I\u2019ll be hitting the Elliptical tonight.\n\nThanks for another fabulous dining adventure guys\u2026 I\u2019m already looking forward to the next time\u2026\n\n#Yummy #Food\n\nL'Andana Grill - Burlington, Ma - 3/29/2016\n\nFrom the minute the valet grabs your key you just know it\u2019s going to be a great night\u2026 The layout is beautiful, the people are super friendly and the service is over the top...My server Eddie knows the menu inside out sideways and backwards and made some awesome recommendations for tonight\u2019s feast.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he brought out was the ciabatta bread\u2026 Toasted with Parmesan, olive oil and dusted with salt, pepper & oregano\u2026 Ornately placed in the olive oil was a ball of slow roasted tomato paste\u2026 It was really quite spectacular...\r\n\r\nThe next recommendation was the cauliflower with roasted parmesan and pomodoro\u2026 A perfect accompaniment to any dinner not often offered in other restaurants\u2026 \r\n\r\nAnd then there was the Tortellini\u2026 Maine crab meat farcito, sweet pea pur\u00e9e & parmesan crema\u2026 So beautifully garnished I felt guilty for eating it\u2026\r\n\r\nThe Gnocchi was over the top\u2026 House made ricotta, henn of the woods, parmesan crema, marsala and truffle Oil... This dish would be tonight\u2019s MVP! Wow\u2026, there are no words...\r\n\r\nMy main course for the evening would come from the sea\u2026 Wood grilled striped bass, cauliflower pur\u00e9e, English peas, baby spring onions, baby carrots, parsley oil\u2026 Tender and flavorful white flaky fish with a seasoned crust\u2026With a side of fire roasted shishito peppers\u2026 The smokey flavour of the wood came thru nicely...\r\n\r\nThe final touch would be the perfectly crafted cappuccino\u2026 The head was perfect and the flavour bold\u2026\r\n\r\nHaving been here before, my expectations were high\u2026 However high they were, once again they exited them.
