So some consideration was appropriate.  Because we were a large party (10) we made reservations a couple of weeks in advance.  We are familiar with the Bertucci restaurants and have always had good meals.  However, this experience was a real downer.  It took over 10 minutes to have a server show up to take drink orders - there weren't more than two tables at the time.  Another 5 minutes to get orders taken and then drinks finally arrived.  At least 30 minutes later, still no food, hadn't seen the waitress and water glasses were empty.  Finally started getting our own water.  Also noticed several groups come in, sit down, order drinks and after 20 minutes, they got up and left.  \n\nFinally, at the 50 minute mark, a supervisor (?) came over to apologize - one server had left, three had called in that they couldn't come in, so that might explain the slow service, however the cooks appeared to be overwhelmed (there were two of them, with the supervisor apparently helping them with pizzas.  When the food finally arrived it came in fits and starts, 3 entrees, then a couple of more, and finally 5 minutes after the entrees started coming, the final three showed up.\n\nAll in all, as others have noted, while the food is good, reasonably priced and abundant, management really needs to sit down with the staff, find out why they can't seem to get their act together, and make some positive changes, this facility will not make it.", "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115653460724814195520/reviews", "time": 1492542469, "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-QMJtTAPAvNQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACnBePZb6_wZeepOPeJHcj_7JNt5aIjWcQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg"}, {"rating": 5, "author_name": "Olia Hapych", "language": "en", "text": "Amazing place with super nice and caring staff. We had a voucher for one free entree if you buy the first entree by yourself. We didn't understand the concept well at first and confused the manager with a lot of questions. At the end we were told that the manager felt bad because he couldn't explain the system clearly to us, that's why we got one free salmon entree+ one large pizza for free! I was amazed at how honest and caring that manager was.\n\nWe weren't even complaining or anything, we were super excited about that free salmon entree anyways,but at the end we got a large pizza for free as well. I couldn't believe it.\n\nFood at Bertucci's is always good, we enjoyed every bite. Their bread and pizza crust is very delicious. Hard to find such a European- style place in America.\n\nI was surprised that people leave bad reviews because of the \"slow service\". I don't agree with that. While you are waiting for your pizza or other food, the employees will always bring you freshly baked bread with oil and spices. \n\n100% recommend this place!\n", "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103915766905873063665/reviews", "time": 1492401183, "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--YX8uxTTAAw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHM/qQ5RxwczTdU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg"}, {"rating": 5, "author_name": "Tom\u00e1\u0161 Odstr\u010dil", "language": "en", "text": "Carrying staff and cosy atmosphere.
