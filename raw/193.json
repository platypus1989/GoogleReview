Once I received a poorly cooked piece of fish; the waitress took it away, the manager came over immediately to apologize and ask what I wanted as a replacement.  The replacement meal came quickly, was really good and the cost was removed from our bill.  That courtesy is rare in any level dining experience these days.  When my grandson traveled with us on one business trip he was treated like a prince and asked to go back.  He then requested dinner at the 99 in Albany, NY when we were headed for the airport nearby to pick up more relatives.  The only drawback at that time was there inability to seat an infant in a car carrier in some way other than squeezing the infant w/carrier and the parents into one side of a booth... work that out with the fire-marshall or unclutter the tables to include space for an infant seat/high chair.  The meals were good and the service friendly here also... just tight quarters.", "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113473018220733539734/reviews", "time": 1473087094, "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ieNwKTsDHWs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACnBePY33ku1ZKP4OxfKi1Y8LsxNOzI31w/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg"}, {"rating": 1, "author_name": "Michelle Griggs", "language": "en", "text": "Every time I go my steak is either raw or overcooked I have to go back every time.
