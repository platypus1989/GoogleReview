Also knew a wait was in order for a busy Saturday night.  However, we were ignored and passed over many times to just place our name for a table.  Our wait was double the time as suggested, yet others entered the restaurant and were seated immediately (groups of 2 to 8), as we overheard non-reservation requests to dine. There were open tables but was told they could not combine tables to accommodate our party of 6 due to policies.  Once seated, apologies were given for our treatment and delay.  Orders taken soon after seating; however not all meals were served at the same time...one was at least 5 minutes after the rest of the party... and one order ( house evening special) was ice cold.  The cold meal was returned and removed from the bill after such request.  Maybe our experience was all just an anomaly because of a busy Saturday night...but overall a frustrating disappointment with very little compassion given from the business side of the equation!  Boston's restaurant scene is vibrant and can be an awesome dining experience as seen during our week stay.
