Story time!\nWe were visiting Needham for a work trip, and Spiga was recommend as \"the spot for a great dinner.\" However, our night ended with awkward looks as we tried to settle the bill.\n\nThe first card we used was declined. We learned LATER after calling the bank that trying to pay at Spiga flipped their flag for \"possible fraudulent activity.\" (Note this is a card that we used to pay for things throughout the trip many time before this meal with no issues). \n\nThe second card we used cleared fine. However, the waiter approached us hostility to ask why we didn't tip. We informed him that since we had a party of 8 that gratuity was included, per their policy. We showed the line on the bill where it clearly showed tip/gratuity.\n\nThat wasn't enough for the waiter. He came back to us with the manager. Both of them asked us why we didn't tip. We explained, a second time, that their policy was that parties of our size had gratuity included. That their system CHARGED us tip/gratuity. It was clearly outlined on the bill.\n\nAfter arguing with us for about 10 minutes, they told us to have a good night. However, I wonder if this is a simple misunderstanding of their own Point of Sale system, or a scam that they use when people are visiting the city from out of town.\n\nPROPS: Food seemed fine. I'll give you 2-stars, hoping this was all an unfortunate misunderstanding. \nSLOPS: See the story above.", "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117034685648818899124/reviews", "time": 1485570527, "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-l-5UF56xZTw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAd0/J9jgC0OKowQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg"}, {"rating": 5, "author_name": "Glen Wilson", "language": "en", "text": "I had lunch.
