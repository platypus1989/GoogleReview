It's ambient and the servers are great. I'm rating it low because we had shocking treatment recently. A table I requested was open but the host refused to seat me and a friend in favor of some other pair who came in after me and at the same time as my friend. The host said we would need to wait 10 minutes. Several other partial parties were seated with friends who were waiting (as in their parties weren't complete and they got seated).  We stood for 30 more minutes as the only people waiting. There was an open 4 top and then another and still we were denied a table. I get that 4 tops aren't for 2 but how long do 2 guests need to stand and wait on a quiet weeknight?
