I sent it back and didn't order anything else.  The waitress came back and said that manager took the cost of the plate off the bill!  Wow!! Does that mean they expected me to pay for it!!!\nWhat a good manager should have done is personally come and apologize for the inferior service in the kitchen, but no, he must have been really busy on this Tuesday evening when most of the tables were empty.  What a joke! That place does not deserve to be visited.
