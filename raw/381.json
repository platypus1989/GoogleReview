Each member of the staff we encountered was friendly, knowledgeable and willing to go above and beyond for the ultimate customer experience. \n\nThe food was presented very well, beer selection was solid and refreshingly cold. I highly recommend the house special eggplant fries, fish & chips and nachos with house chili. The sirloin steak special and steak tips however were a definite let down. Perhaps ordering to our taste of medium well was a mistake, however they turned out to what seemed as extra well done which resulted in a dry and charred experience. \n\nWill most likely visiting again due to the amazing service from the staff. \n\n", "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117436045642246974073/reviews", "time": 1495983764, "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fozNoqY0kQ4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAABYk8/9GH7NIOqLiY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg"}, {"rating": 5, "author_name": "Joseph C", "language": "en", "text": "If you're in Needham, this is a great place to grab a bite.
