The place is set back from the road across from the golden arches. There is a parking lot. The food seems like pretty standard American food selections. My burger was good and I had it with a beer from a better than average draft selection. The fries left something to be desired. My wife had a Cobb salad which came layered like a parfait in a large mason jar. She thought it was cute but I thought it was impractical. I guess we see the world differently. They have a kids menu and the wagon wheel pasta was a hit. Sports were on a couple of TVs around the restaurant. I am sure I will visit again at some point and I will give the ol' burger and fries another try and maybe revisit the rating. To me fries are important.

Don't know where to begin. How about no kids' menu? 99% of Newton brings their children to dinner. Goodbye Grande, back to the Biltmore. The website boasts 20 beers on draft but actually there are only 12. The menu is limited and the prices are offensive. Not to mention, unless you're eating Raman noodles at an upscale Raman restaurant, who wants pork belly? The pretend flatbread is a joke. Go to Anthony's for a real pizza for $2 more. Finally, the last straw was being told that a 7% beer could only be poured in a tumbler glass due to its alcohol content. Excuse me? I will just go to any other bar on Earth that pours pints. No matter what. Oh and what's up with the temperature? Hotter inside than it is outside with an entire front-facing bar with windows that do not open?!
