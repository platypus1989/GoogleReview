Having a sub done in under 30 seconds or whatever as they say isn't worth it . Subs are bland and I find this worse then subway . Only had 1 kind of cheese ..... strange ..... no Swiss . No American !? Like what the hell is this ? Plus your paying huge prices when you get chips and a drink for an 8inch sub it's almost 12 dollars ! Sooooooooooo I SUGGEST if you wanna stick around you adapt a little bit . Just a little . Your in Boston . Not in the sticks somewhere in some no name town .  Get some variety . Quality cold cuts and then charge me 12 dollars for a sub . I'll be happy to pay it . But you gave me 2 slices of ham and one slice of the only cheese you have and a Ton of dry lettuce . Barely any mustard and put tomatoes on it when I said no tomatoes and no peppers when I said peppers . Chips kinda suck too . Soda was good . Fast service was good . But in the end I felt like I could have had a new born baby make a better sandwich if I put the ingredients in front of them . \nGotta little work to do Jimmy", "relative_time_description": "in the last week", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110707755074436779733/reviews", "time": 1506807257, "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZIt0kW3XmDY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/uxfDesdv-0o/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg"}, {"rating": 4, "author_name": "Foad Torshizi", "language": "en", "text": "After 7 years in New York, where Jimmy John's is woefully absent, I was truly excited to order my favorite no. 16.
