I told the front desk when placing reservations that it was a special evening with my wife and I wanted a both if available.\n- My wife got the NY sirloin, asked for it to be cooked Medium. I was surprised with how much effort it took to saw through the steak. In my experience, that's normally a pretty easy cut.\n- Somehow, my wife wound up holding the door open for a man that I assume was the GM. She is not above holding the door open for anyone, but as we walk out of your establishment after paying more than $100 for dinner I would think that a restaurant that went as far as sitting out or silverware between courses, would give a \"guest first attitude\". Especially when it's a woman dressed up in heels holding the door for a man that works there.\n\nIn all, we won't be back unfortunately.
