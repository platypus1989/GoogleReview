It's a casual place with a bar and Red Sox on TV. I ate new and delicious foods. I kept eating until I was full and then some. Almost until dignity went out the window. It was so good. There is a second more Americanized menu and the items listed there looked plenty delicious (Pad Thai, etc.) but I can't comment on them specifically.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive. There are small alcoves with booth seats and space for fairly large parties. While I was there a group of 10 or so came in and were seated without fuss. The restaurant itself is a quick walk from a couple of different T lines. I walked from Chinatown in less than five minutes.

Green curry and Massaman. I would rate 3.5 out of 5. Their cocktail drinks were great. \n\nCons:  Over pricey and they gave us the bill with 18% tips on top of the bill. Their service was not great. So, I would hardly give them 12-15% tips, if I had an option. But they do not give it an option. I found their staff a bit rude, so i decided to let it go and not argue on sake of not spoiling my day.\n\nThey do not accept credit card. They take only cash but they charge sales tax and tax on alcohol cocktail drink (they charge tax twice). You know what that means. The tax they charge on you will not go to govt. It goes to their pocket. We took a couple of drinks. They charged tax twice. Overall, they do a big cheating in billing.
