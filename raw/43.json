However, as I have noticed during previous visits, management is not on their A-game.  We came this past Saturday, 7/22 around 1 in the afternoon. Our server was working on the patio yet had to take two tables in the complete opposite side of the restaurant! Why? It's not like there was only one server on...A manager then had to help her, running food and drinks to the table. This is not the first time I have noticed or experienced this at this establishment. I have seen ONE bartender be in charge of the bar,  and have about 12 tables in the bar area. I have seen servers' tables be scattered across the restaurant in different sections. It's unfair to the servers but also doesn't make for a pleasant visit.
