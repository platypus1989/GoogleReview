I was hopeful.  The restaurant is small but cute. We popped in around 6pm on a Saturday night. I ordered the ribs and the pimento cheese. My guy ordered the fried alligator and the gumbo.  He said he liked his food. He didn't love it. It was his first time trying alligator and he said it was okay, chewy, but probably wouldn't order it again. Not the restaurant's fault at all. Everything was presented nicely. My ribs were a little too dry and overdone.  I didn't care for the sauce slathered over ribs, I favor  a dry rub with sauce on the side. It was quite sweet. I also didn't care for the collard greens. I'm no collard green expert, but I prefer a more smoky, less sweet/vinegary version. Again, personal taste. The mashed potatoes were outstanding. I didn't love that I couldn't get a diet soda either. I don't drink alcohol and water or sugared drinks were my only option other than water. Our waiter didn't offer us dessert, so I can't even say what was on the menu. All in all, I was disappointed.
