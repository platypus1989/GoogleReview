We tipped accordingly and I hoped it would be done and it wouldn't ruin our nice trip. However, she chased us out onto the sidewalk to demand to know what the tip was for. I told her it was due to her service and she proceeded to look at my friend and her wonderful, loving, kind mother and gave them the dirtiest look and said \" It's in their nature.

The main lady who runs this place is extremely rude. All of the other younger male bus staff were very friendly but to be in the service industry and to have a extremely bad attitude doesn\u2019t seem right. Lady do something else if you\u2019re not happy.\n2. We just got back from Rome and wanted authentic Pasta Carbonara. If you search google or yelp people suggest this is the place to go. NO. It was terrible as well as the other four dishes we ordered. Store bought pasta with store bought Alfredo sauce is not authentic Italian. It is embarrassing that all of our meals had store bought pasta that was over cooked. The red sauce tasted like Prego. My humble suggestion, sell your location to someone who cares about the food and will make homemade pasta and sauce.\n3. We waited way too long for our food. We watched three tables come in, be sat, get food, finish, and close out before we had plates. We were only a four top so there is no logical reason for that.\nUnfortunately the North End has a handful of places like this that stay alive by the unsuspecting tourists.

Our server chased us down and said, 'It is in their nature not to tip....the blacks.'\n\nI called ahead to make a reservation at this place thinking it was Saturday in Boston. My family, a friend and I arrived a little early and the host was a rude, stand offish man, who did not pay attention to me when I told him about the reservation. That is, until my friend spoke up. My friend is Caucasian and I am south Asian. \n\nWe got seated and woman came over for our order. My glass was dirty so I requested that she change it and she grunted, clearly displeased by that request. The service was very poor. She came over twice, once to take our order and once to serve us. Each time she was frustrated and rude with us. We felt unwelcome in their establishment and decided that the service did not deserve a generous tip. As we walked towards the door to leave, the woman chased my friend down and asked her about the tip. My friend politely said that the food was good but the service wasn't. She then looked at my mom and I and said that it was in our nature not to tip...the blacks. This was the first time she made eye contact with us. Appalled at what she had said we walked back to our car in horror.\n\nOur experience with this horrible place does not end here. We found out later, that we were greeted by Anthony, the owner of the establishment. And his mother, Lucy was our server. We called the next day and asked for an apology. We were directed to a lawyer who accused us of not paying. \n\nMr. Anthony, yes we paid for our meal which included a tip that was certainly not deserved considering the service we received and the verbal abuse that followed. And no, the amount we tipped was not because of the color of my skin. It was because of the most unpleasant experience we ever had.
