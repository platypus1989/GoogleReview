I admit that the food here is okay/good but the service is just too bad, at least this is what I experienced: 6 of us chose to sit at 2 small tables at the corner but the waitress keep telling us to sit in the middle of the hall. This could be a kind notification but I don't think we did something wrong by having our own preference. HOWEVER, here comes the annoying part: They then tell us that the corner tables are hard for the food cart to get in and we might be ignored and hope we don't complain about this part. FINE, this is okay, I can still walk to the cart and order some food when the it is close by. BUT when people are waiting at the doorway, the waitress came frequently and keep asking if we will order more, if not, we should leave. WTH??? Is this how they treat the customers? Having dim-sum is a way of leisure and I pay for the service, the food and the time of JOY as I stayed there. I understand they try to earn a lot of money by rotating more rounds of customers, but this shouldn't be an excuse to kick other customers away. Don't tell me they won't serve each of us if we separate into 6 different tables and of course, we are paying the same amount of tips. Despite that, some people who don't speak Mandarin or Cantonese are also ignored because having dim-sum is different than ordering food by the menu. They don't know this and none of the waiter/waitress guide them. It ends with sth like this: A family of 6 left by eating one dish. Once again, the food is okay, but I do hope they train their staff better before serving as a real restaurant who takes tips by offering rudeness.
