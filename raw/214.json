There was an elderly woman also waiting for a cup of coffee who they yelled at too and acted like she was a total pain. All the other employees were just standing around doing nothing and talking to each other. This is the second awful experience I've had there, my boyfriend was working on a job up the street and would go there daily but stopped because the workers were so rude.
