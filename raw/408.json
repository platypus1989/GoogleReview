No other customers in sight she was doing something on her phone. She looked at us and proceeded to gather menus. I thought \"ok at least we'll get seated.\" Nope. She placed them on the counter and walked away. Minutes later we were seated with a smile like nothing happened. The waiter was in no hurry to refill our coffee. The food was bland. I ordered a scramble and it tasted like something from a college dorm; overcooked eggs, no flavor.
