We noticed 2 waiters chatting with the receptionist and no one cared about the customer waiting in front of them.  We decided to walk out. When we were leaving, the waiter next to receptionist wished us good night. The receptionist told him that they did not have dinner yet, but he did not care to ask why we are leaving.

I usually don't write reviews but after Jim came over to us I was watching him while there and I saw him constantly cleaning and attending to other tables and conversating with other tables. I noticed he was extremely involved in his restaurant and very professional. I will set come here from now on. We shook his hand as we left and thanked him for everything he had done.
