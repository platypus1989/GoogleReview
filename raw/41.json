Additionally, waitstaff don't usually just stand there and watch someone who's had a few too many go to multiple tables and sit down or physically attach themselves to others.\n\nThe staff should have handled the situation differently, including by asking her to leave when she tried to smoke inside before being served at the bar.\n\nI likely would not return for another meal.", "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111385966847082677377/reviews", "time": 1501678602, "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZIzuTV28MMg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAC_A/0k54k61yg8c/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg"}, {"rating": 2, "author_name": "Susie Christoff", "language": "en", "text": "Had lunch outdoors ...
