Other employees tried to INSULT my friend for even showing up there! My other friend asked him a simple question in a polite way and he screamed in her face TOO and tried to tell her to not come back!! The people working there now have RUINED the Big A and it\u2019s good name! I feel bad for the previous owners who worked so hard to manage the place because now it is no longer a nice establishment in Malden:( They all need SERIOUS TRAINING ON HOSPITALITY and to just learn how to talk and approach people in general. They need to treat every person who walks through the door like a customer or that person NEVER WILL BE! They just lost a loyal customer who\u2019s family had been going there for over 10 years...until I met the new owners. It \u2018s just sad. Now their food is sloppy and no care goes into it. The tables are all dirty and chairs have food left on it. I sat down to lunch and got CHOCOLATE ON MY PANTS THAT WASN\u2019T MINE!!!! The owner was very eager to yell at us but when they see us cleaning our own table not an ounce of movement from any staff to offer a rag or even to clean it themselves. I\u2019ve gotten better service from an ice cream truck than this place. I honestly feel bad for anyone who has to go through the treatment that I received from them.
