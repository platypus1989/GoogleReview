They focus on fish and the raw bar and everything I've had in that regard has been delicious. Oysters? Fantastic. But many of the menu dishes, most meant for sharing, have been a touch disappointing--especially given the price. Every dish seems to be about 25% overpriced, and not as well imagined as the food at, say, Sarma. The nights I've been there servers have seemed a little overwhelmed, as well. The cavernous space is invariably packed, making the noise level akin to a jet engine; conversation becomes difficult. Similarly, the lighting is kept so low that diners use their phones to read the menu. This is a simple issue easily resolved by candles, which would provide not only lighting by which to read but also a better ambiance than the interrogation light of the iPhone 6.", "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103852800190169915317/reviews", "time": 1501605662, "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-O7C3Zyo8WTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAARg/LHHzwgejcRg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg"}, {"rating": 3, "author_name": "Jamise Osserman", "language": "en", "text": "I enjoyed a few bites of my husband's seafood tower.
