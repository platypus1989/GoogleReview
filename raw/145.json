Okay fine whatever. I order just water (I went really for the ride). My friends ordered soda and their food. When we got our drinks she didn't give us straws, we had to call her back and get some. When the food arrived two of my friends got tacos and the shells weren't even cooked. She gave us silverware but only gave us like two minutes to grab a pair before she took them away. \n\nBefore we ordered our food we ordered for the friend that was running late. When he sat down she came out and gave his soda and meal in to go containers. Umm what?!? I know you guys are closing in like thirty minutes but that's not perfessional at all. She then started taking our plates and drinks away with out asking if we wanted a refill or anything because the dishwasher is complaining he was closing dish. Again very unprofessional.  She then got annoyed when we had asked her if we could split the bill she sighed when we asked. \n\nThe only good thing that came out of this night when the very flamboyant man at the bar. He came over and said hi and told us a few jokes that he had with an older woman the nigh before. I wish I got his name. He made our night.
