Yes, the bathroom is small, but the room itself was outstanding. It seems like the hotel underwent a very extensive renovation and the rooms are very trendy.

You have access to the rail system within walking distance, which was perfect for us. Service was outstanding and I enjoyed the mix of a historic hotel with a modern feel.
