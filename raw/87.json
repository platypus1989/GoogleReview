She actually asked someone else to take it for me behind the counter but they refused so she did. She was very nice to do that, and much appreciated. Come to find out the other lady behind the counter that refused, bad mouthed me and my baby to the next person in line, which happened to be my friend. She said people with kids just can't do anything for themselves these days. And something else that I won't post here. I didn't ask for help. I appreciated it though.

We did get our burgers, which were really good and reasonably priced for what you get. The patties here are huge in area, like a pancake, but not super thick.
