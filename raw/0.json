Portions are completely different than any other subway I've been to and I get the exact same salad every time. The whole way through I kept asking the individual if it was correct portions and he kept saying yep. The amount of spinach given was so little that you couldn't even see the spinach amongst all the other ingredients. The individual helping me, heavier set older man, kept putting the salad in the mix bowl and then back into the tray. Handled my food as if it was raw meat he was dealing with. No care whatsoever that I'm watching him handle my food so poorly. I was expecting some kind of remedy for the lack of spinach but that's not what happened. Literally had to leave the subway store.
