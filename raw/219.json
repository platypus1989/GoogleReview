Tender, with waves of flavor as you bite and then chew, the burger nearly melts in your mouth. So Craigie on Main got the one big thing right. But they also do all the little things right too which is why it earns 5 stars. The bartender was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The steak fries were crisped perfectly while still keeping the potato inside soft and flavorful. The bun, just the right size for the patty, topped with sesame seeds, grilled on the inside without being crunchy, threatened to fall apart as I finished the burger but never did. The cheese was subtle but gradually came into its own and enhanced the flavor of the meat. Portions were sensible. Service was quick although in fairness they knew i was coming and what i was ordering.
