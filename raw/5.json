Not in the least. I had a terrible experience last week at this location and emailed Bertucci's corporate office immediately after returning home. This it has been almost a week and I still haven't gotten a response from anyone. I am still shocked by my experience and decided to let everyone know, especially people with children, how I was treated at this so called \"kid friendly\" restaurant. I was unable to share my email I sent due to its length. Long story short, after sitting down and ordering food, my two year old son had a tantrum and after not being able to calm him down, I took him outside for a walk in his stroller where he fell asleep. When I returned, the manager told me I could not bring my son in the stroller back to our table because the stroller was a fire hazard. Her solutions for me were to leave my party (of 6) and sit alone at a different table near the front. Or that I could take my food To-Go and leave. I was so stressed out after my sons tantrum and having to spend twenty minutes outside walking around to get him to sleep. I couldn't believe that the manager gave me such a hard time. Ultimately, my server was happy to accommodate us and moved our seats and made room at our table for my sons stroller. By the time I got to eat my food, it was cold. Had I not been held up at the front of the restaurant by the manager, I would have had a hot meal. The manager never apologized. And I can't believe corporate hasn't reached out to me to make things right. There was plenty of space for the stroller, completely out of the way of foot traffic. The stroller was no bigger than a wheelchair. Does this establishment not allow handicap people in wheelchairs because wheelchairs are fire hazards? I'm still shocked. Never been treated this way in my life.", "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116254778745584860360/reviews", "time": 1500561796, "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-lLCeQjTFNb8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAs/hwzGDAi0jGc/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg"}, {"rating": 2, "author_name": "Stirling Madison", "language": "en", "text": "It is typically a very good place and very consistent food but stay away on the Monday 3rd of July or the Friday after Thanksgiving.
