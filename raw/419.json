Food was also very authentic, to the point that eating it gave you a little piece of history. Extensive wine and cocktail list  Portions are large which is great for getting full.\n   Cons - overall, food was not as enjoyable as you'd expect for the price. Large portions ended up making their more overwhelming dishes even more overwhelming.\n\nAppetizers were the best part of the meal and by no means a disappointment. My crab cake was almost entirely crab, with a big, fresh crab flavor. The bottom was perfectly browned which tasted delicious and gave it a nice crunch. My girlfriend's cheese plate was also great, the highlights were the brie, gouda and cherry jam. The brie was super creamy and rich. The gouda had a perfectly subtle smokiness and had an addicting, warm, buttery aftertaste. The cherry jam had an intense, tart cherry flavor which, like everything else on the plate, went amazingly with the cheeses. \n\nEntrees weren't great. The crushed cracker and white wine crust on my baked schrod was almost impercievable and very buttery. With the mound of buttery rice on the side and only a small portion of bland vegetables on the side to cut it, the butteriness became overwhelming, especially because of the huge portion. My girlfriend's venison was elegantly simple but with fairly bland sides. Because there was nothing for the strong gaminess  of the meat to stand up to and because it was such a large portion, it quickly became overwhelming as well.\n\n Deserts were not great either. My strawberry cheesecake was cloyingly sweet. The white chocolate topping made the sweetness more difficult to handle. A strawberry topping would have cut the sweetness and improved the dish, especially considering that the \"strawberry\" cheesecake only had a quarter of a strawberry in the dish. My girlfriend's Boston cream pie was a bit mushy and the cream filling was lacking a rich cream flavor. Instead, the filling was more like a dense vanilla pudding. \n\nWhen you're paying over $70 for a full meal, all of the food has got to be great but it wasn't. Despite going against intuition, the huge portions made my meal worse in my opinion. Other than that, a good experience and I still had fun.
