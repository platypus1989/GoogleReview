We had wanted to go to another restaurant in the area, but couldn\u2019t get a booking, so we decided to check out the Zef- Cicchetti and Raw Bar.\nWe arrived early enough to get a seat and we were extremely pleased with our choice. I loved the atmosphere of this restaurant, as the bar area was open and tables were uncluttered and well spaced. Also, it is connected to Alba\u2019s restaurant, so you can move between both easily. They have a great selection of both beer and wine, which was reasonably priced. \nWe started with the polpette, which are meatballs in a tomato sauce and they were very tasty.\nFor the entr\u00e9e, my husband had the pork osso bucco and he raved about it. The meat was slowing cooked, tender, and flavorful. It was served on mashed potatoes and had a masala sauce over it. It was a big serving and he was extremely happy.\n\nI had the black truffle gnocchi, which was served with short rib, wild mushrooms and a sauce. It was delicious and although the plate looked small, it was extremely filling and delectable.\n\nI think what made the greatest difference of this restaurant was the bar staff and our server Leo who was personable and attentive to everyone that he served. I will be back to visit soon and would recommend it to everyone.", "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114959806841784149898/reviews", "time": 1492307696, "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-z5auSmC2ZfQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACnBePYFirqXYr_MGK4k1hJsTQLBAmXzZQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg"}], "formatted_phone_number": "(617) 481-4848", "address_components": [{"long_name": "1472", "types": ["street_number"], "short_name": "1472"}, {"long_name": "Hancock Street", "types": ["route"], "short_name": "Hancock St"}, {"long_name": "Quincy", "types": ["locality", "political"], "short_name": "Quincy"}, {"long_name": "Norfolk County", "types": ["administrative_area_level_2", "political"], "short_name": "Norfolk County"}, {"long_name": "Massachusetts", "types": ["administrative_area_level_1", "political"], "short_name": "MA"}, {"long_name": "United States", "types": ["country", "political"], "short_name": "US"}, {"long_name": "02169", "types": ["postal_code"], "short_name": "02169"}]}}
