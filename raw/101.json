Aside from a sub bread's general appearance, quality and taste, I care a lot about the bread thickness in relation to its fillings, or how \"bready\" a sub is.  Well, they nailed it - the bread's never been too thick and/or too chewy, and a there's a faint hint of a certain sweetness that makes the bread pop with each of the sandwiches I've tried since they opened.

I went in & the girl at the register gave me an awkward look & I asked \"what time do you close?\" She replied \"Im a little bit\". I asked her at what time do you close...she again did not give a specific time reiterating that they're closing. I told her that she didnt have to lie & per the online info you close at 11pm. All i wanted was some food after a hard days work. She proceeded to tell me that they \"guy\" in the back already cleaned up.
