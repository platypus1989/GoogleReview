A family was sitting at the table behind me (the only black people in the restaurant). My wife and I had the same waitress as them; who kept coming up to our table, but did not once go to theirs the whole time they were sitting there. She brought them food but did not give them any silverware, napkins or anything.  They were very calm, I turned over to one of the people on that table and told him to ask for a manager seeing how rude the waitress was to them and how nice they were about it. I heard them ask for a manager and refuse to pay a gratuity, this kid was very polite, the whole time.\n The manager came over, he explained the situation to her, and my wife and I were just shocked to hear the manager completely berate him and tell him how rude he was to the waitress when we heard the entire conversation. She said her waitress was upset which I did not get why, when she was the one being rude to this family the entire night.\n The manager then starts screaming at them in front of everyone and the guy only then yells at her, telling her to be respectful . She screams at them, telling them to leave and even called the police who refused to remove them, and everyone saw it. I think the Police told the manager she was wrong, and everyone sitting there could see it. After the officers left the place, the family eventually got up and took off as well. Good for the police for standing up for people like that. Shame on that manager for her awful behavior in the face of her staff's obvious racist behavior. Such people and behavior should not be tolerated.\n\nIf you read this review, good for you for standing up for your family dude, and even better how you kept calm. the waitress and her manager were absolutely wrong for the way they treated you, maybe it wasn't but it really felt like simple racism to my wife and I sitting there and we definitely are not going back there.\n\nIt was not my first time at John Brewer's, but it surely is the last.", "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116100910300535940352/reviews", "time": 1499271249, "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-pDCmmnmc2qk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACnBePaDH-abQAo7BHEpxWqYLa5DkM9L0w/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg"}, {"rating": 5, "author_name": "Linda Ryan", "language": "en", "text": "Always a great meal and love our outdoor experience here.
