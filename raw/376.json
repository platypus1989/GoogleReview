I went in with my friends and from the very beginning you could tell there might be a bad experience. The waitress was nice but that probably where the compliments end. She brought 4 unwanted drinks and ignored the requests. It took us 30 mins to just order and when we did end up getting our food a lot was wrong and it was full of flaws. I ordered a medium 10 oz serloin and it came out looking like a over sized hockey puck. It was well done and not that tasty. The mac n cheese was good but the mashed potatoes were sub par. My friend also revived a messed up steak that could have been passed off as a burger. It also had some saut\u00e9 stuff on it that was not good nor wanted. To top off our experience the fire alarm went off and the whole restaurant needed to be evacuated.
